            <p>
                <span>[0002] It is generally accepted that production lines with widely varying HMI designs </span>
                <span>will suffer from reduced operator efficiency, which </span>
                <span>will likely lead to longer downtime events, lower throughput, and reduced job satisfaction. </span>
                <span>To help counter these issues, the following guidance will establish a set of Human-Machine </span>
                <span>Interface implementation standards that, when employed by production machinery designers, </span>
                <span>will establish the consistency necessary to accommodate the specific needs of the production-line operator.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0003] In addition to the standards established in this document, the guidance will communicate </span>
                <span>a collection of more generic interface design best practices. We argue that the general level of </span>
                <span>usability within machine HMIs can always be improved. Accordingly, this document will provide </span>
                <span>guidance in the areas of usability and graphic design, which should benefit design engineers </span>
                <span>seeking to expand their background in those disciplines. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0004] To accompany the recommendations offered throughout, this guideline presents a collection </span>
                <span>of reference material from which many of the best practices have been established. Readers are </span>
                <span>encouraged to explore these references, particularly those that fall outside the scope of </span>
                <span>their primary discipline. Throughout, an underlying theme will become evident; </span>
                <span>the designer is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the operator. Put bluntly, the </span>
                <span>operator's inability to comprehend or effectively use an interface is the fault of the designer. Errors </span>
                <span>incurred due to flawed design are not the responsibility of the operator, but are instead, </span>
                <span>evidence of a failure on the part of the designer. It is our expectation that readers of </span>
                <span>this guidance are willing to accept that responsibility and do their best to optimize </span>
                <span>their operator's experience.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0005] Success in the above endeavor, however, is not possible if designers work in isolation. </span>
                <span>Designers must collaborate with operators to understand their goals and the environment </span>
                <span>in which they work. Additionally, designers must collaborate with their peers to examine their work </span>
                <span>with a critical eye and to better understand successful designs and the underlying mechanisms that </span>
                <span>help achieve the desired outcome. The recommendations provided here advocate these additional steps, as </span>
                <span>they are essential to the development of optimally usable designs.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="Goals">2.2 Goals</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0006] As stated previously, this guidance is targeted at designers for the benefit of operators. </span>
                <span>By improving the environment in which operators work, producers will ideally realize </span>
                <span>reductions in downtime, increased throughput, lower levels of rework, and operators with higher </span>
                <span>levels of job satisfaction. Moreover, standardization in specific areas of the human-machine interface </span>
                <span>should aid in the development of cross-functional production operators that can move from line to </span>
                <span>line with greater efficiency.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0007] The best practices offered throughout are provided to encourage continuous improvement on </span>
                <span>the part of system designers. Our ability to effectively communicate with the operators </span>
                <span>through the equipment we design can always be improved. The provided guidance is </span>
                <span>simply a starting point for designers seeking additional exposure to the usability and graphic </span>
                <span>design disciplines. Proper application of the provided recommendations is ultimately dependent on the context in question; </span>
                <span>evaluating the resulting designs via operator testing is essential. Getting it right the first time is a lofty goal, but </span>
                <span>getting it right is paramount. With a greater understanding and ability to control the way operators </span>
                <span>experience the equipment, it is expected that the designers will likewise experience </span>
                <span>greater job satisfaction.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="GuidanceStructure">2.3 Guidance Structure</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0008] This executive summary concludes with section 2.4, which provides a complete, yet succinct, listing of </span>
                <span>the individual HMI standards (i.e., stacklights, state model diagrams, and navigation systems). </span>
                <span>These "standard executive summaries" provide only those details necessary to comply with the requirements. </span>
                <span>The abbreviated versions are expanded in the later </span>
                <span>sections of the document, where more detailed explanations are paired with numerous examples to </span>
                <span>guide those responsible for the practical implementation of each topic. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0009] Section 3 presents a brief review of key usability concepts and the related design principles. This </span>
                <span>background material establishes the foundation upon which the remainder of the guidance is built. </span>
                <span>Related topics include: (a) the important characteristics of the production operator, (b) the universally </span>
                <span>accepted characteristics of usability, and (c) a summary of the models that represent situation awareness and decision making. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0010] Sections 4, 5, and 6 offer a detailed walk through each HMI standard, including supplemental </span>
                <span>content that is provided to explain the topics in terms of the established usability principles. </span>
                <span>For each standard, these sections offer (a) a fully annotated review of the standard itself, </span>
                <span>(b) supporting background content, and (c) related best practices. Those specifically interested </span>
                <span>in the stacklight design, for example, can focus exclusively on section 4.2, which </span>
                <span>presents the annotated standard. The remaining content in section 4 will then focus on the underlying usability </span>
                <span>principles and best practices that we feel to be most relevant for effective stacklight design. While we </span>
                <span>expect this usability content will be beneficial to all readers, it is understood that the core </span>
                <span>requirements of the standard specifications will likely take precedence in many instances. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0011] Having fully explained the standards in sections 4 through 6, section 7 follows with recommendations on </span>
                <span>design evaluation and continuous improvement. Again, while this content will not include additional standards, </span>
                <span>it is offered for those seeking guidance on design refinement and validation. </span>

                <span>The standard state-lamp mappings &ndash; illustrated in Figure 1 &ndash; define whether </span>
                <span>each lamp will be off, solid, or flashing given the current machine state. A similar convention, </span>

                <span>Horizontal alignment is required for the following groupings: a) Unholding, Held, Holding, b) Idle, Starting, Execute, Completing, </span>
                <span>Completed, c) Resetting, Unsuspending, Suspended, Suspending, and d) Stopped, Stopping, Clearing, Aborted, Aborting.</span>
                <span>Vertical alignment is likewise required for the following groups: a) Idle, Resetting, Stopped, b) Unholding, Starting, Unsuspending, </span>

                <h3 id="OperatorEmpathy">3.1 Operator Empathy</h3>
                <p>
                    <span>[0020] In order to appropriately design machines that will ultimately meet the needs of the operator, </span>
                    <span>we must first establish the characteristics that are critical to success.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0021] The first relevant operational aspect to be taken into consideration is that the operator responsible for multiple </span>
                    <span>machines does not simply stand by and monitor a single HMI. Therefore, when a downtime event is triggered by a  </span>
                    <span>specific machine in a complex line, it is highly likely that the operator is not present. Accordingly, effective communication  </span>
                    <span>with an operator that arrives after the occurrence of a critical event will prove to be an essential skill. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0022] The downtime example is further complicated by the urgency of the situation. While poor design is more easily </span>
                    <span>accommodated under normal operating conditions, a downtime event introduces additional stress on the operator. It </span>
                    <span>is reasonable to argue that the likelihood of interface-manipulation errors will increase under this additional urgency. </span>
                    <span>Abnormal operating conditions clearly amplify the impact of flawed design. Accordingly, </span>
                    <span>the designer must take care to consider both the environment and conditions under which the operators perform.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0023] The associated goals and context in which operators work should be in the forefront of the designer's mind </span>
                    <span>as each HMI decision is made. Understanding and empathizing with the operator is a great motivator for </span>
                    <span>the engaged designer.</span>
                </p>
                <h3 id="UsabilityCharacteristics">3.2 Usability Characteristics</h3>
                <p>
                    <span>[0024] With a handful of critical operator characteristics understood, it is next important to establish the scope </span>
                    <span>of the term usability. Nielsen (1993) presents a set of usability characteristics to help clarify the concept; the </span>
                    <span>usability of a machine is a function of its (a) Learnability, (b) Memorability, (c) Efficiency, (d) Fault Resistance </span>
                    <span>and Tolerance, and (e) the level of Satisfaction experienced by the operator.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0025] Within the scope of production environments, system learnability is most relevant for operators interacting with a piece of </span>
                    <span>equipment for the first time. Here, the operator's ability to quickly build fluency in the associated machine interface is a key measure </span>
                    <span>of the designer's success. Similarly, an operator's ability to become productive when transitioning from one </span>
                    <span>machine to another is a function of the latter machine's level of learnability; standardization is a big help in this scenario.  </span>
                    <span>It is important to note, however, that expert users (i.e., those executing advanced functionality) will still require </span>
                    <span>specialized training and significant practice before they are able to effectively perform certain higher-level </span>
                    <span>tasks. This is completely acceptable; the learnability characteristic is simply not applicable in these </span>
                    <span>cases. Learnability optimizations are generally not a substitute for proper training and practice. Design techniques like </span>
                    <span>Progressive Disclosure help illustrate this distinction. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0026] Most easily demonstrated by examining the design of digital printing interfaces, progressive disclosure is a technique </span>
                    <span>whereby expert-level controls and interfaces are segregated from the components that are most frequently utilized. In a typical </span>
                    <span>printer interface, a small number of core facilities (e.g., number of copies, page selection, orientation) are presented </span>
                    <span>in simple dialogs similar to that shown in Figure 5, </span>
                    <span>while more advanced features (e.g., color management, page setup) are hidden in "Advanced" submenus. </span>
                    <span>This separation optimizes the basic interface, providing an environment that is less likely to overwhelm the average user. </span>
                    <span>Accordingly, this technique presents an interface that is highly learnable. The number of options are minimized, leaving a smaller subset of features that must be learned. </span>
                    <span>Expert users instead utilize a separate section of the interface that is dedicated to their more specialized </span>
                    <span>needs. Improving the efficiency for the expert user by mixing more complicated features with basic tools would </span>
                    <span>complicate the interface to the disadvantage of the average user. This should be avoided. Isolating the advanced features is </span>
                    <span>the appropriate design compromise in most situations where mixed audiences exist. </span>
                </p>

                        <span>Figure 5: Print dialogs typically hide expert-level controls behind "Advanced settings" shortcuts that offer interfaces more suitable </span>
                        <span>for the advanced audience. With the advanced features hidden away, the resulting basic interface is simpler and easier to learn. This design </span>
                        <span>concept is known as progressive disclosure; additional content is presented in levels appropriate to the audience. </span>

                <p>
                    <span>[0027] Learnability is generally measured by presenting new users with an interface-based task. </span>
                    <span>The time required to complete the task is then a reasonable quantitative metric of the system's learnability. When compared to either an </span>
                    <span>existing design or a competing design alternative, the magnitude of the improvement attributed to the new design will help validate the underlying concept. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0028] In a well-functioning production line, it is likely that an operator will have infrequent interactions </span>
                    <span>with the HMI. When the operator returns to a machine after a prolonged absence, the memorability of </span>
                    <span>the HMI becomes the focal point. Will the operator need to relearn the interface or is there some level of </span>
                    <span>retention that allows a returning user to become productive more quickly than a new user? </span>
                    <span>Testing memorability is generally more difficult than testing learnability as some period of inactivity is required </span>
                    <span>to evaluate how effectively the interface accommodates the returning operator. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0029] Maintaining the downtime example discussed previously, an operator's ability to quickly identify and </span>
                    <span>resolve an event is a perfect demonstration of the Efficiency characteristic. If instead, the operator must struggle </span>
                    <span>through multiple steps with uncertainty and confusion, the downtime event will likely persist for an </span>
                    <span>unacceptable period. When considered as raw metrics, the efficiency of a production machine is best </span>
                    <span>characterized in terms of the time necessary to complete specific tasks; OEE is rooted in such thinking. While it is often argued that the </span>
                    <span>number of steps taken (e.g., taps, key presses) is a worthwhile metric, we argue that a single step that </span>
                    <span>takes 5 minutes due to operator uncertainty is much less efficient than 50 steps that require minimal </span>
                    <span>thought and take a total of 10 seconds to complete. While lowering the number of required steps is a worthy objective, time </span>
                    <span>to completion is usually the more important goal in production environments. Measuring efficiency often </span>
                    <span>warrants some amount of task repetition. During such testing, the first few iterations will </span>
                    <span>constitute a measure of learnability. Once the task is learned, a more accurate measure of efficiency </span>
                    <span>can be achieved through several additional repetitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0030] Efficiency can often be improved through the addition of shortcuts that simplify frequently used interactions. </span>
                    <span>Standard multi-step operations (e.g., menu navigation or command sequences) can be optimized in ways that </span>
                    <span>benefit advanced users without interfering with novice operators. On-screen touch shortcuts, for example, </span>
                    <span>accelerate the efforts of expert users without cluttering the interface with additional content. While the novice user is still able to </span>
                    <span>employ the standard mechanism, the expert user achieves the same result with fewer steps. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0031] Likewise, a system that helps operators avoid errors will likely pay dividends in both the efficiency and </span>
                    <span>satisfaction categories. Extra, unnecessary HMI steps performed due to uncertainty on the part of </span>
                    <span>the operator are a prime example of waste when considered from the lean manufacturing viewpoint. </span>
                    <span>Producing designs that minimize such waste accommodate the Fault Resistance objective. Moreover, </span>
                    <span>a system that can efficiently resolve slips or mistakes (e.g., undo to recover from accidentally </span>
                    <span>deleting a product configuration) warrants additional points in the fault tolerance category. Facilities </span>
                    <span>that accommodate fault tolerance will generally improve efficiency and overall operator satisfaction as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0032] While the Learnability, Memorability, Efficiency, and Fault Awareness characteristics are well </span>
                    <span>aligned with quantitative metrics, the Satisfaction characteristic is much more qualitative in </span>
                    <span>nature. The subjective opinions of the operator can be difficult to accommodate. Designing a </span>
                    <span>satisfying interface generally requires (a) a good understanding of the operator, (b) an understanding of the context </span>
                    <span>of use, and (c) an understanding of the operator's goals. When the operator and the associated work environment are at </span>
                    <span>the forefront of the designer's mind, they will be better able to comprehend the subjective envelope of satisfaction. </span>
                    <span>With that understanding in place, proper application of basic design principles will likely yield an interface that is satisfying. </span>

                <h3 id="SituationAwareness">3.3 Situational Awareness</h3>
                <p>
                    <span>[0033] Given the previously discussed usability characteristics, it is next necessary to consider how a </span>
                    <span>given machine can effectively (a) communicate a condition and (b) direct the operator to the appropriate </span>
                    <span>course of action. Endsley (1995) offers a model for Situation Awareness (SA) that breaks such interactions </span>
                    <span>into three distinct levels. First, the model declares that the operator must perceive a given condition. The associated stimulus could be </span>
                    <span>a horn, a stacklight, a message on a display, a pile of products on the production floor, or </span>
                    <span>the smell of burning plastic. Having achieved Level 1 SA, the operator must then appropriately </span>
                    <span>interpret the situation. What does the light mean? Why are there items on the floor? What's that </span>
                    <span>smell? Finally, after Level 2 SA is achieved, the operator must project the current situation into the future. Perhaps the light </span>
                    <span>is only a warning indicator that requires action to prevent a less desirable outcome. At this stage, </span>
                    <span>the operator has achieved Level 3 SA and must make a decision and, optionally, perform some course of action. </span>
                    <span>Ideally, the achieved level of awareness is not flawed and contains no level of uncertainty. The appropriateness of the operator's response </span>
                    <span>is contingent on the effectiveness at each subsequent awareness level. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0034] Ultimately, the designer is responsible for ensuring that the situational awareness is not flawed and contains </span>
                    <span>minimal uncertainty. If the operator does not perceive the light because it is obscured from </span>
                    <span>their vantage point, they have no reason to consider its meaning. Or, perhaps, a horn from a </span>
                    <span>different line distracted their attention. Ensuring that the stimulus is effectively perceived </span>
                    <span>is the first challenge. Design principles offered throughout this guidance focus specifically on effective communication. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0035] Comprehension of the situation with respect to the operator's goals is the next challenge. Given </span>
                    <span>a fully integrated production line and a standard stacklight convention, the operator will be </span>
                    <span>responsible for monitoring the lights on the entire production line. If the operator observes a light </span>
                    <span>transition from green to blue, the operator must interpret that light transition both in the context </span>
                    <span>of the individual machine, and in relationship to the other machines on the line. Once both the </span>
                    <span>observation and comprehension are achieved, the operator will determine, for example, that the </span>
                    <span>wrapping machine is running low on film. Having made this determination, the operator will consider </span>
                    <span>the level 3 SA needs, which address how the current conditions will impact the future status </span>
                    <span>of the line.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0036] Continuing the example of the machine running low on film, the operator will likely consider how </span>
                    <span>urgent the situation is. If the operator understands that an additional 15 minutes of production can be expected following the </span>
                    <span>first instance of an alarm, the operator will consider this point when choosing a course of action. </span>
                    <span>Perhaps there is sufficient time to complete another task before addressing the active alarm. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0037] Understanding this basic model of situation awareness is a great benefit to designers. By </span>
                    <span>understanding the basic thought process of the operator, and the relevant levels therein, </span>
                    <span>the designer is left with only a few basic questions when evaluating a design. Will the </span>
                    <span>operator see the stimulus I have designed? If the stimulus is provided on screen, is the </span>
                    <span>intended focal point sufficiently salient, or is there other "digital noise" distracting </span>
                    <span>the operator's attention from the critical indicator? Will the operator comprehend the feedback </span>
                    <span>from the machine, or is the signal ambiguous, leaving the operator with a high level of </span>
                    <span>uncertainty? Finally, does the machine simplify the operator's ability to predict the future </span>
                    <span>outcome? Does the system warrant an explicit message communicating the time remaining until a </span>
                    <span>critical system stoppage? This would certainly help the inexperienced operator that does not </span>
                    <span>yet understand the relationship between system events. When considering the appropriateness of the design, the designer </span>
                    <span>can utilize the situational awareness model to help direct and evaluate potential solutions.</span>

            <p>
                <span>[0043] The associated standard PackML implementation for push-button controls (e.g., start, stop, reset) follows </span>
                <span>conventions like those defined for stacklights. While adhering to the basic </span>
                <span>color and marking requirements for push-buttons specified in IEC 60204-1:2016, the PackML </span>
                <span>standard requires that illuminated push-button actuators use the sequence mapping detailed in Figure 7 and Table 1. </span>
                <span>The Reset and Start buttons will flash to communicate that the operator must press the respective button to initiate </span>
                <span>a transition to the subsequent PackML state (i.e., Clearing, Resetting, Starting). Illuminating the Stop button is not  </span>
                <span>required. Also, note that the flashing-green Start button is aligned exclusively with the flashing-green lamp, </span>
                <span>but that a similar perfect correlation does not exist for the Running condition (i.e., solid-green lamp and solid Start button). </span>
                <span>Moreover, note that there is no relationship between the blue lamp and the traditionally blue Reset button. </span>
            </p>            
            <p>
                <span>[0044] The underlying state transitions associated with the push-button controls align specifically with the Clear, Reset, Start, </span>
                <span>and Stop commands defined in the PackML state model. The Start and Stop buttons trigger the associated Start </span>
                <span>and Stop commands, whereas the Clear and Reset commands are both associated with the Reset button. </span>
                <span>The implementation of the Reset push-button sequencing (i.e., off, flashing, or solid) will be applied in an appropriate </span>
                <span>device-specific manner. Following an emergency stop, for example, the system will transition to the Aborted state where an </span>
                <span>operator-initiated press of the Reset button is likely necessary to trigger the transition to the Clearing state. Similarly, </span>
                <span>an open door may trigger the Stop command, which will </span>
                <span>send the machine to the Stopped state where the Reset command is required. If an operator-initiated Reset is required in this </span>
                <span>scenario, the Reset button must flash. Note that the path from Aborted </span>
                <span>to Idle (i.e., the path through Clearing and Stopped) requires both a Clear and Reset command, both of which will be mapped to  </span>
                <span>the flashing Reset button. For machines where the full Aborted-to-Idle path can be traversed safely, a single-press reset </span>
                <span>is permitted. For machines where an operator-initiated reset is not required, the flashing Reset button is likewise not required. </span>
                <span>In short, whenever an operator-initiated reset is required, the Reset button must flash. </span>

                <span>[0045] Figure 8 presents a composite diagram demonstrating the PackML states associated </span>
                <span>with the red and green lamps. The diagram shows the state flow and the associated transitions </span>
                <span>of the lamp and push-button light sequences. In the Stopped state, the red lamp will be solid </span>
                <span>and  &ndash; if an operator-initiated reset is required &ndash; the Reset button  </span>
                <span>will be flashing. When the Reset button is pressed, the system will transition </span>
                <span>through Resetting to the Idle state, where the Start button and green lamp will begin flashing. </span>
                <span>Upon a press of the Start button, the green lamp and Start </span>
                <span>button will display solid through the Starting state to the Execute state.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0046] When the Stop button is pressed, the green lamp will turn off and the red lamp will </span>
                <span>display solid. The system will then transition to the Stopped state where the Reset button </span>
                <span>will again return to a flashing sequence if an operator-initiated Reset action is required. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0047] Alternately, from the Execute state, for example, the system will transition to the </span>
                <span>Aborting state when the E-Stop is engaged. On this transition, the red lamp </span>
                <span>will begin flashing. When the system reaches the Aborted state, the Reset button will begin flashing. </span>
                <span>Once the E-Stop is cleared and the Reset button is pressed, the system will transition through the </span>
                <span>Clearing state until the transition to the Stopped state completes, where the red lamp will light solid. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0048] The sequence demonstrated in diagram Figure 9 will execute on systems that employ the Completing transition. </span>
                <span>The Complete command will initiate the sequence sending the machine through the Completing state where the green </span>
                <span>lamp will remain on and the Start button will remain illuminated. When the Completed state is reached, the green </span>
                <span>lamp will clear, and the red lamp will light. At this point, the Start button will clear and the Reset button will </span>
                <span>begin flashing. This condition matches the equivalent response that occurs when the system reaches the Stopped </span>
                <span>state presented as the entry point in Figure 9.</span>

                <span>For example, should the machine determine that its local material store is critically low, this condition </span>
                <span>will be communicated to the operator by flashing the blue lamp. The operator will then have </span>

                <span>which indicates that material has been exhausted to the point where production can no longer proceed. </span>
                <span>As demonstrated in Figure 12, the flashing blue lamp will accompany a second lamp, which indicates the </span>
                <span>current machine state. The lamps will be lit simultaneously to communicate the Hold warning and the active machine state. </span>
                <span>If the Held state is reached, the blue lamp will then be lit solid where is will stay until the material </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0052] Given the associated PackML states, the top-down orientation </span>
                <span>of the lights follows western cultural conventions where the </span>
                <span>most critical elements are positioned at the top. This cultural convention is evident </span>
                <span>in the indicator light descriptions of IEC 60204-1:2016, from which  </span>
                <span>this PackML stacklight standard is derived. Here, the </span>
                <span>Stopped and Aborted states are presented at the top of the </span>
                <span>stacklight, communicating their importance through their color </span>
                <span>(e.g., red or amber) and, perhaps more importantly, their </span>
                <span>position. The sequence attribute (i.e., flashing or solid) </span>
                <span>further communicates the urgency of the current state. It is </span>
                <span>accepted that the flashing light will draw more attention than a </span>
                <span>solid light, therefore, the flashing sequence is associated with </span>
                <span>the more urgent PackML states (e.g., Aborted is more urgent than </span>
                <span>Stopped). Note specifically here, that a machine approaching a Held </span>
                <span>condition (e.g., material low), is considered more critical than </span>
                <span>a machine that is actively held. Together, the attributes of color, position, and sequence </span>
                <span>represent hierarchy within the state model. Lights in a higher </span>
                <span>position are more urgent than those in a lower position, while </span>
                <span>lights that are flashing are more urgent than those that are </span>
                <span>solid. Similarly, through cultural convention, red is more urgent </span>
                <span>than amber. Keep culture in mind when designing as these conventions </span>
                <span>may not hold in all contexts. Hierarchy in the graphical interface will utilize </span>
                <span>these same attributes, as well as others, to establish focus, </span>
                <span>guiding the operator's attention to elements that are most </span>
                <span>essential to the task at hand.</span>

                <span>a mispositioned light (e.g., amber above red), such a violation would surely </span>
                <span>be a distraction to a line operator. It is expected that a focused color-sighted </span>
                <span>line operator could overcome a violation of the light position standard. However, </span>
                <span>under the additional stress of a line stoppage, a simple lack of consistency in </span>
                <span>stacklight orientation could lead to an extended stoppage. Accordingly, we will </span>
                <span>highlight consistency in orientation as a key usability principle, one that will </span>
                <span>be revisited in the discussion on navigation design.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0054] Moreover, it is essential that the color and sequence attributes of the </span>
                <span>associated stacklights be implemented in a consistent fashion within a single </span>
                <span>production facility. While an operator will most likely overcome some level of </span>
                <span>inconsistency in the size or color of the red stacklights across a number of </span>
                <span>machines in a single production line, a deviation in the frequency of a flashing </span>
                <span>light could draw undue attention to a single machine. A machine stacklight </span>
                <span>flashing at a higher rate will draw more attention than surrounding machines </span>
                <span>blinking at a lower rate. Such scenarios should be avoided by establishing a </span>
                <span>standard flashing frequency within the line.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0055] These points illustrate the relevant distinction between internal and external consistency. </span>
                <span>Utilizing the same size and shape lenses within a single stacklight of a given machine </span>
                <span>demonstrates the most basic application of internal consistency. A lack of consistency in a </span>
                <span>single light of the stack &ndash; a different shape or size, for example &ndash; would draw </span>
                <span>additional attention from the operator. This should be avoided unless the additional attention </span>
                <span>is a desirable effect. External consistency, on the other hand, is demonstrated by using the same </span>
                <span>top-down sequence of colors in the PackML stacklights across a production line containing </span>
                <span>machines produced by multiple vendors. When we discuss standardization, external consistency </span>
                <span>is generally the objective as it accommodates consistency across facilities and organizations. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0056] An additional application of consistency evident throughout this design </span>
                <span>is the requirement that at all times at least one of the lamps will be illuminated. This </span>
                <span>requirement helps eliminate uncertainty on the part of the operator. The absence of an </span>
                <span>active lamp could lead the operator to believe that the machine is either off or malfunctioning for some reason. </span>
                <span>Keeping at least one lamp illuminated at all times is an important communication mechanism. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0057] Finally, while not explicitly discussed in IEC 60204-1:2009, external consistency (i.e., across machines) </span>
                <span>with respect to the relative orientation of the push-button controls for Start, Stop, and Reset </span>
                <span>is highly recommended. As with the stacklight example &ndash; where color and </span>
                <span>position combine to communicate state &ndash; the dual coding of marking and positioning of push-buttons </span>
                <span>reduces the likelihood of error on the part of the operator. However, consider the impact of two </span>
                <span>adjacent machines where the orientation of the Start and Stop buttons are reversed. While </span>
                <span>inconsistency in orientation should be avoided if possible, the optional introduction of color </span>
                <span>can aid the operator when positional consistency cannot be guaranteed.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="StacklightsAlignment">4.4 Alignment</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0058] While it is likely taken for granted in the design of stacklights, alignment </span>
                <span>is a key component of usability. Operators will conceptually group items that are </span>
                <span>aligned with one another. The vertical alignment of the stacklights communicates this relationship. </span>
                <span>Accordingly, it is important to align components that are related; the alignment reinforces the </span>
                <span>relationship for the operator. Conversely, it is equally important </span>
                <span>to avoid aligning components that are unrelated, particularly if an assumed association could increase </span>
                <span>the likelihood of operator confusion or error. Lamps that serve some purpose other than communicating </span>
                <span>PackML state should be positioned on a separate stack to achieve alignment isolation, which will help avoid distraction and confusion. </span>
            </p>

            <h3 id="StacklightsProximity">4.5 Proximity</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0059] Given the importance of the orientation and alignment principles, it is equally important that </span>
                <span>the PackML stacklights and push-button controls be positioned in a manner that ensures safe operation and effectively communicates </span>
                <span>the respective association with a given machine. While operator visibility is a key </span>
                <span>requirement for effective positioning, a stacklight that is not sufficiently </span>
                <span>positioned with respect to the machine could fail to effectively communicate </span>
                <span>the PackML state. Moreover, a PackML stacklight that is not consistently positioned </span>
                <span>within the relative body of the associated machine may not be appropriately identified </span>
                <span>if multiple stacklights with similar colors are present within the machine's proximity. </span>
                <span>Accordingly, it is recommended that the PackML stacklights be positioned such that a </span>
                <span>line operator with a view of the production line can consistently identify the PackML </span>
                <span>stacklights for each machine and correctly interpret the machine responsible for a </span>
                <span>line stoppage or hold event. Stacklights for other machines should be positioned with </span>
                <span>sufficient separation to ensure their status is not misplaced. Additionally, as safety is paramount, the </span>
                <span>proximity of push-buttons must be managed to ensure that operators have clear visibility </span>
                <span>of the associated machine whenever the Start button is pressed. </span>
            </p>

            <h3 id="StacklightsContrast">4.6 Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0060] The discussions of consistency, alignment, and proximity highlight the overarching </span>
                <span>importance of contrast. We are instinctively designed to identify contrast. When contrast exists without cause, </span>
                <span>we can be left confused, searching for the meaning. Contrast can communicate organization through either </span>
                <span>simple groupings or more detailed hierarchies. We perceive contrast in color, brightness, </span>
                <span>size, polarity, orientation, and position. Proper use of contrast is essential to effective communication in interface design.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0061] While it is again expected that sufficient contrast will exist between a lit and </span>
                <span>unlit stacklight, we will belabor the example to highlight the related design concept. </span>
                <span>Within a stacklight, it is expected that an individual lamp will provide sufficient </span>
                <span>brightness to ensure that an operator can effectively distinguish between the lit and unlit states. </span>
                <span>Likewise, it is expected that the contrast between lamps (e.g., red to amber) is sufficient to ensure </span>
                <span>that the operator will correctly &ndash; without hesitation &ndash; identify the active lamps. </span>
                <span>It is important to note here </span>
                <span>that the operator's ability to interpret the correct lamp states is a function of both </span>
                <span>the lights themselves (e.g., brightness, color) and the surrounding environment. Specifically, it </span>
                <span>is critical to consider the operator's perspective when viewing the lamps. It is possible that the </span>
                <span>structures behind a stacklight will impair the operator's ability to correctly perceive the active </span>
                <span>lamp. Proper positioning of all operator interfaces should take into consideration the impact of the </span>
                <span>surrounding environment and context of use. </span>
            </p>

            <h3 id="StacklightsContrast">4.7 Speaking the Operator's Language</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0062] While it is reasonable to use the conventions of position, color, and sequence to draw </span>
                <span>an operator's attention to a given machine, it is still necessary to communicate the </span>
                <span>required course of action in a manner that speaks more directly and effectively to the </span>
                <span>operator. It is not sufficient, for example, to blink the blue lamp in the stacklight and expect the operator to know </span>
                <span>what action is necessary. While the push-button controls offer guidance in some scenarios, the </span>
                <span>graphical interface must effectively communicate the </span>
                <span>meaning of the blinking blue lamp by presenting an instruction that leads to a prompt </span>
                <span>resolution.</span></p>
            <p>
                <span>[0063] Operators that have been drawn to a machine with an effective stacklight indication should </span>
                <span>be greeted with a message they can appropriately identify and act upon. Hierarchy within the </span>
                <span>graphical interface is essential for this task. The approaching operator should quickly identify </span>
                <span>the required action when they scan the graphical interface. Instructions that lack prominence </span>
                <span>will delay the recovery of the production line. Lack of contrast and emphasis (e.g., size, boldness, </span>
                <span>color) will reduce the saliency of the operator instruction. Be sure the instruction presented to </span>
                <span>the operator is easily identified. Testing of the implementation should be employed to ensure the instructions are identified </span>
                <span>in a consistent manner.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0064] Avoiding generic instructions (e.g., HELD) in favor of machine specific instructions (e.g., Empty </span>
                <span>the Under Bin and Press Start) will expedite operator response and line recovery. Where appropriate, </span>
                <span>utilize conventions like AECMA (Association Européenne des Constructeurs de Matériel Aérospatial) </span>
                <span>Simplified English, which communicate to a broader audience through grammatical conventions. While </span>
                <span>the guidance specifically targets English-speaking operators in international contexts, the conventions demonstrate the more broadly applicable importance of establishing </span>
                <span>language patterns that are sufficient to reduce the required level of language </span>
                <span>proficiency (Mills & Caldwell, 1997). Similar guidance is offered in the forthcoming Safety of Machinery  &ndash; </span>
                <span>Instruction Handbook ISO 20607. As noted by the scope of that standard, if effective communication affects </span>
                <span>safety, it surely impacts usability as well. In general, interfaces should avoid abbreviations, jargon, acronyms, </span>
                <span>and engineering-centric language, which will likely be lost on line operators. Reserve engineering conventions </span>
                <span>for log files, which will not require interpretation from line operators.</span>

            <p>
                <span>[0065] This section of the guidance will specify the steps necessary to present the standard ANSI/ISA </span>
                <span>TR88.00.02-2020 PackML state model in a consistent and effective manner. More specifically, this section focuses </span>
                <span>on the unique requirements for presenting the state model on a machine's HMI. In keeping with the themes </span>
                <span>expressed previously, the guidance and associated design requirements prioritize the goals of the production-line operator. </span>
                <span>The guidance illustrates the typical design challenges that designers must overcome and offers specific recommendations </span>
                <span>that focus on accommodating the needs of the production operator. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0066] From the engineer's perspective, the state model &ndash; demonstrated again in Figure 14 &ndash; represents </span>
                <span>the underlying control programming that ensures machines across a production line will operate in a correct and </span>
                <span>predictable fashion. Achieving this level of standardization across the packaging industry has elevated the </span>
                <span>state model diagram to iconic status; a symbol of the collaboration and harmonization achieved within the industry. </span>
                <span>Does this representation hold equivalent value for the operator? Likely not. The operator simply needs to understand </span>
                <span>the current state of the machine and any actions necessary on his or her part. Accordingly, while the traditional visual representation </span>
                <span>is encouraged where it can be accommodated, a faithful representation is not paramount. </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>[0067] Fortunately, despite some level of imprecision, the active machine state will be adequately represented by the </span>
                <span>stacklight and push-button standards established here. The associated HMI components (i.e., lamps and illuminated buttons) visually communicate </span>
                <span>the current machine state (e.g., Held, Suspended) and direct the operator when command execution is required (e.g., Reset button blinking). </span>
                <span>With the exception of the solid green lamp, activity is required when any other lamp sequence is active (e.g., Flashing Green, Solid Red). While these components </span>
                <span>satisfy many of the requirements that might otherwise be communicated through the state diagram, the lamps and the </span>
                <span>state diagram cannot directly communicate the machine-specific causes of certain production conditions (e.g., bin full, material low); </span>
                <span>communicating this information via text instructions on the HMI display is more appropriate. To that end, we argue that using precious HMI screen real estate </span>
                <span>to communicate specific detailed information (e.g., data, trends, operator instructions) is more critical than displaying the PackML state diagram. </span>
                <span>The associated requirements for a Standard PackML State Model HMI Representation are aligned with these priorities.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0068] With this scope established, the following sections will outline the specific requirements and guidance related to </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0069] Displays presenting the PackML state diagram must maintain the alignment demonstrated in Figure 15. For example, horizontal </span>
                <span>alignment of the Unholding, Starting, Unsuspending, and Stopping states must be maintained. Likewise, vertical alignment of the </span>
                <span>Idle, Starting, Execute, Completing, and Completed states must be maintained. If a properly aligned diagram cannot be displayed </span>
                <span>(e.g., screen size too small) then the full diagram should not be displayed.</span>
            </p>

                    <span>If the alignment demonstrated in the right-hand example cannot be maintained, then the full diagram should not be displayed. </span>

            </figure>
            <p>
                <span>[0070] When displaying the state model, all states should be displayed regardless of their implementation in the active </span>
                <span>PackML mode. If &ndash; for example &ndash; the Completing and Completed states are not implemented in the current PackML mode, </span>
                <span>these states should still be displayed in the diagram. Their representation, however, should be muted to communicate that </span>
                <span>they are not active within the model. Figure 16 demonstrates a representation of the state model where the </span>
                <span>Completing and Completed states have no functional purpose (i.e., they are pass-through states) and are therefore presented with a reduced level of contrast.</span>

            <p>

                <span>When compared to the example on the left, the redesigned alternative in Figure 17 presents the operator with just as much information; </span>
                <span>the machine is in the Execute state. That is not to say, however, that the minimalist representation is sufficient. The redesigned alternative </span>
                <span>in Figure 13 can now accommodate additional information, which will enhance the operator's situational awareness. </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0074] Tufte (1983) argued that the data communicated by a given display should always be optimized and that unnecessary noise should be eliminated. </span>
                <span>Originally considered in the context of </span>
                <span>print media, the optimal data-ink ratio is one where every drop of ink contributes value equal to its intensity. If the ink does not </span>
                <span>communicate any data then its place on the page cannot be justified; zero value, zero ink. Carrying the argument further, if the ink contributes </span>
                <span>only a small amount of data value it should be presented with a limited amount of visual impact (e.g., small, low contrast). Figure 19 presents </span>
                <span>a scatter plot redesigned to optimize the data-ink ratio. In this example, the outer border of the plot is completely removed as it holds no </span>
                <span>data value. The grid lines and axes are redrawn in a less dominant grey color, which replaces the more bold black color used in the original. </span>
                <span>The individual data points are redrawn without an inner fill, which is more conducive displaying overlapping points while also presenting a </span>
                <span>more light-weight esthetic. Each of these changes contributes to a higher data-ink ratio. Overall, the impact of non-data-ink is reduced, </span>
                <span>therefore, the ratio is improved. </span>
            </p>

                    <span>Figure 19: The chart on the right has been redesigned to produce an equivalent with a higher data-ink ratio. The left-hand chart's </span>
                    <span>border is removed and the black grid lines and axes are replaced with less dominant grey equivalents. The solid data points are </span>
                    <span>replaced by points with stroke but no fill. Some axis labels are removed, others are simply replaced by smaller grey equivalents. </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0075] This simple concept facilitated the more heavy-handed redesign demonstrated in Figure 17. </span>
                <span>Often, it is far too easy to add digital ink to a display. The urgency to fill every empty space with content is natural for those </span>
                <span>confined within the borders of a QVGA display. However &ndash; from the operator's perspective &ndash; the majority of the PackML state model </span>
                <span>is digital noise. The inactive PackML states (i.e., those states supported by the machine, that are not currently active) provide no additional </span>
                <span>information to the operator. Rendering those states, therefore, is not </span>
                <span>beneficial to the operator. Figure 17 offers the minimalist equivalent of the state diagram. It satisfies the most important question </span>
                <span>the complete diagram can: what is the current state?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0076] The redesigned alternative, however, is not necessarily sufficient as it leaves gaps in the operator's situational awareness. </span>
                <span>With the space reclaimed by eliminating the non-data-ink, the design can now accommodate additional data that could not be rendered </span>
                <span>in the previous visualization. Additional questions can now be answered. How long has the machine been in the Execute state? </span>
                <span>What is the current OEE? How many times has the machine been Suspended or Held since Starting? Presenting such data offers far more </span>
                <span>value than rendering 17 inactive machine states. As stated previously, the appropriate questions will depend on the target machine </span>
                <span>and the associated production environment. The Data-Ink Ratio concept simply guides the designer to ensure that the rendered content </span>
                <span>is focused, first and foremost, on communicating data. Every pixel should be optimized to ensure it communicates either data or nothing. Accomplishing </span>
                <span>this objective requires a proper application of contrast within the interface.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="StateModelContrast">5.4 Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0077] An HMI with properly applied contrast will help the operator focus their attention on the areas of a display that are most </span>
                <span>relevant to the task at hand. An interface that is densely populated with content can still highlight key pieces of data without </span>
                <span>the noise of supplementary data distracting the operator's attention. Contrast is achieved by varying the intensity of the elements </span>
                <span>displayed on the screen. For text elements, contrast can be achieved by varying the font size used to display the associated content. </span>
                <span>Additionally, text can be presented in different colors (e.g., black or grey) to communicate the level of emphasis appropriate for the </span>
                <span>content. By carefully selecting an appropriate text size and color for each screen element, the interface will communicate hierarchy without </span>
                <span>the need for heavy-handed visual guides. Considering again the minimalist PackML state diagram presented earlier, Figure 20 presents a simple, yet consistent </span>
                <span>application of contrast aimed at guiding the viewer's attention toward data and away from "noise". In this example, one could argue that </span>
                <span>the labels decorating the actual data constitute noise. In order to effectively balance the interface, the design must use text size </span>
                <span>and color to direct the operator's attention across the display toward the key pieces of data, with minimal emphasis on content that </span>
                <span>does not contribute to situational awareness.</span>
            </p>

                    <span>Figure 20: Contrast can be used to focus the operator's attention on specific screen elements. The "Execute" PackML state is presented </span>
                    <span>in black with a 52 pt font size. This is the most visually dominant screen element in terms of both size and color. </span>
                    <span>The Time in State, OEE, and Held Events values (i.e., 14:23, 78%, and 6, respectively) are the next most salient, displayed in a dark </span>

                    <span>Finally, the labels (i.e., "Time in State", "OEE", and "Held Events") are shown in a lighter grey at a 16 pt font size. These combinations </span>
                    <span>of color and size establish hierarchy within the display, which guides the operator's eye more efficiently. </span>

            <h3 id="StateModelConsistency">5.5 Consistency</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0078] Given the previous argument that all non-data-ink should be eliminated, it is reasonable to question the decision to display </span>
                <span>PackML states that are not supported in a particular mode for a given machine type. Since these states do not communicate any data, the display's data-ink </span>
                <span>ratio would clearly be improved if they were hidden. In this scenario, however, we argue that establishing consistency </span>
                <span>of the display should take precedence over the data-ink ratio. The goal of providing the operator a consistent interface while </span>
                <span>concurrently reducing the data-ink ratio is achieved by reducing the effective contrast of the PackML states that are not </span>
                <span>represented in the active machine mode. A muted representation for one or more states, as demonstrated in Figure 16, is sufficient to communicate </span>
                <span>the fact that the associated states are not part of the target machine's PackML State Model. </span>
            </p>            
            <p>
                <span>[0079] Consistency is therefore employed to avoid any distractions to the operator. Maintaining proper alignment within the state model </span>
                <span>avoids unnecessary confusion. By following the standard, the operator will not interpret misaligned states as something meaningful. The </span>
                <span>operator will never question why there are gaps in the state model. Muting inactive states is a necessary compromise to both maintain </span>
                <span>consistency in content and alignment, while concurrently communicating the nature of those states within the model.</span>

            <p>
                <span>[0080] The previous discussion of contrast hinted to the effectiveness of color in highlighting elements on the screen. The example </span>
                <span>in Figure 20 demonstrates that the pure black text provides the maximum level of contrast against a white background. Demonstrated </span>
                <span>again here in Figure 21, we see that increasing the level of brightness in a color transitions that color toward pure white, which </span>
                <span>provides no contrast against a white background. The grey levels achieved in between pure black and pure white allow the designer to </span>
                <span>provide a level of contrast appropriate to a specific task (e.g., data: black, labels: grey, grid lines: light grey). In the digital RGB (i.e., Red-Green-Blue) </span>
                <span>color model (i.e., that used by many design tools), pure black is represented as RGB: 0, 0, 0, whereas pure white is represented as RGB: 255, 255, 255. </span>
            </p>

                    <span>Figure 21: Pure black (i.e., RGB: 0, 0, 0) provides the maximum level of contrast against a pure white (i.e., RGB: 255, 255, 255) background. Increasing brightness in 20% increments transitions </span>

                <span>[0081] When a specific hue is selected, like the cyan background of our sample PackML diagram, the level of impact contributed by the color is correlated to the saturation level. </span>
                <span>Figure 22 demonstrates the impact of reducing the saturation of a cyan hue (i.e., RGB: 0, 217, 255). </span>

                <span>[0082] When used together, the hue, saturation, and brightness (HSB) properties provide a convenient alternative to the more common RGB color model as </span>
                <span>the HSB model provides a more intuitive approach to color design. Given a specific color, adjustments to the saturation and brightness properties </span>
                <span>will produce a second color that appropriately complements the original, while being more subdued or more bold. Figure 23 demonstrates some of the </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0085] In general, highly saturated colors should be reserved for the select interface components requiring the most attention. </span>
                <span>In this example (i.e., the background colors of the PackML state diagram) it is difficult to argue that such a highly </span>
                <span>saturated color is warranted. While there is sufficient contrast between the active state (i.e., Execute) and the background, </span>
                <span>a more neutral background is likely warranted. In this situation a more desaturated color would make a more suitable backdrop </span>
                <span>for the state diagram. Additionally, considering data ink ratio once again, it is also reasonable to remove the solid black border </span>

                <span>Finally, the size of the inactive state labels has been reduced &ndash; from 10pt to 8pt &ndash; leaving the active state more visually dominant within the display. </span>

                <span>[0089] In these diagrams, color has been applied merely as a mechanism to align with the stack light standard. Misinterpretation of colors </span>
                <span>in this context is of little concern as only one state will be highlighted at a time. More care must be taken when misinterpretation of color </span>
                <span>can cause a misunderstanding on the part of the operator. A carefully designed color palette will help ensure that color-blind operators </span>
                <span>are accommodated. The examples in Figures 29 and 30 were generated using a special color-blindness filter available in Adobe Illustrator. </span>
                <span>Such tools allow the designer to see how their interfaces will be perceived by color-blind operators. Employing dual-coding </span>
                <span>(e.g., color plus text) is recommended in more complicated contexts.</span>

                <span>&ndash; each dedicated to a specific purpose &ndash; that bring order and communicate purpose for the remaining content. </span>
                <span>This unique combination of text sizes (i.e., 16 pt and 29 pt in grey and dark grey respectively) introduces a pattern that the </span>
                <span>viewer can anticipate and easily interpret. By consistently using these same sizes for the same purpose in the other </span>
                <span>areas of the HMI, the viewer will quickly identify data values and labels in a more instinctive manner. This improves both </span>
                <span>the learnability and memorability qualities of the interface.</span>
            </p>  
            <p>
                <span>[0092] Instead of using an arbitrary collection of text sizes, the example employs typographic scaling, which brings harmony to the display </span>
                <span>using a fixed multiplier that builds each successive text size from the last. </span>
                <span>The scale ensures that there is sufficient visual contrast between the display's effective </span>
                <span>levels (e.g., machine state, data values, data labels) such that the underlying hierarchy is more easily interpreted. </span>
                <span>Figure 31 presents some alternative typographic scales to help illustrate the concept. </span>
            </p>

                    <span>Figure 31: Smaller typographic scales offer less effective hierarchy in the display. Larger scales offer more contrast, but </span>
                    <span>are more difficult to accommodate on smaller screens or more densely populated displays. Utilizing color is an effective </span>
                    <span>alternative to produce hierarchy at smaller scales. </span>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                <span>[0093] An effective typographic scale is established by first identifying </span>
                <span>the smallest effective text size. In this sample, a modest 16 pt text size has been selected. In keeping with the data-ink ratio concept,  </span>
                <span>this minimum text size will be used to present the least data-rich content (i.e., data labels). In practice, the appropriate minimum text </span>
                <span>size will be impacted by the size of the screen, the viewing distance and angle, the quality of the display, and several other </span>
                <span>context-specific variables that impact readability. Once the appropriate minimum size is determined, a fixed multiplier is selected </span>
                <span>to provide a linear increase in the text size of subsequent levels. A relatively large multiplier </span>
                <span>of 1.8x has been chosen in this example. With only 4 pieces of information, the interface can accommodate a larger scale than would </span>
                <span>otherwise be available on a display with more densely populated content. </span>                
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0094] The smallest scale in the example (i.e., 1.3x) provides less natural hierarchy via size. The hierarchy is enhanced through color, where </span>
                <span>the smallest text is presented in grey to produce additional contrast. At a scale of 1.8x, the hierarchy is more pronounced. The grey coloring on the data label </span>
                <span>is still utilized as there is no reason to increase the emphasis on that content. Progressing to the 2.5x scale shows more dynamic contrast, which </span>
                <span>is certainly more pronounced, but does not necessarily produce a more functional or aesthetically rich display. </span>
                <span>Altering the typeface itself, however, does offer an opportunity to improve both the aesthetic and functional characteristics of the interface. </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0095] Figure 32 illustrates some of the flexibility offered by various typefaces. While Arial Regular and Halis Rounded Book </span>
                <span>offer similar personalities, variants like Arial Narrow help illustrate the functional benefits that some alternative fonts can afford. With a more compact </span>
                <span>body, Arial Narrow requires less horizontal space to display equivalent content without sacrificing height and, therefore, legibility. </span>
                <span>The demonstrated Halis fonts help illustrate the dynamic contrast afforded by light weight and small cap fonts. Light fonts are simply </span>
                <span>the opposite of more commonly utilized bold fonts. An alternative to smaller font sizes or lower contrast colors, a light font positioned </span>
                <span>adjacent to a regular font will likely draw less attention, while adding a clean and efficient aesthetic to the display. The small caps variants </span>
                <span>offer another method for drawing extra attention to an element. While it is more difficult to read content that is capitalized, it will draw extra </span>
                <span>attention from the viewer. Accordingly, caps and small caps should be avoided for longer text segments, but are appropriate for alarms and warnings. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0096] Figure 33 illustrates the differences between a true small caps font displaying the letters "Execute" and a normal font displaying the </span>
                <span>characters "EXECUTE". The illustration shows the the small caps font produces a larger leading letter "E", while displaying smaller capital letters </span>
                <span>for the remainder of the word. Contrasted with the fully capitalized "EXECUTE" rendered in the normal font, we see that the more horizontal space is </span>
                <span>used and that there is more space between the individual letters. The small caps font is specifically designed to provide a more aesthetically pleasing </span>
                <span>rendering of the fully capitalized equipment. With less space between the letters, the small-caps version produces a visual that appears to be more fluid. </span>
            </p>

                    <span>in Halis Rounded Book against the Small Cap equivalent, we see that the Small Cap version is more efficient in horizontal space, and, arguably, </span>
                    <span>more aesthetically pleasing.</span>

            <p>
                <span>[0097] When longer runs of text are required, it is important to consider line spacing and line length. It is generally accepted that longer line </span>
                <span>lengths slow down reading speed. Additionally, it is more difficult to read text where the distance between lines is too small. Figure 34 </span>
                <span>demonstrates the impact line height has on legibility. Utilizing the preferred 120% guideline produces a more readable body of text.</span>

            <p>
                <span>[0098] While efficient use of screen space is a lofty goal, it should not come at the expense of the operator. Poor legibility </span>
                <span>will impair operator performance, particularly under stressful conditions. Accordingly, line height should be optimized </span>
                <span>whenever the underlying design tools will accommodate such control. </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0099] For most production operators, time spent manipulating an HMI is time wasted. Engineers that </span>
                <span>design machine interfaces have an important responsibility to ensure that their operators perform </span>
                <spam>effectively. If an operator is not effective when utilizing a designer's interface, it is the </span>
                <span>designer who has failed, not the operator. In an effort to increase the likelihood of success for </span> 
                <span>our fellow designers, this section offers a standard graphical interface template tailored </span>
                <span>specifically for use in production environments. Isolated machine-level testing has demonstrated </span>
                <span>that the following guidelines offer measurable usability benefits, with further improvements expected </span>
                <span>when the practices are applied across full production lines. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0100] Understandably, given the vast array of facilities in a typical interface, </span>
                <span>establishing an appropriate scope for this section of the standard was the first critical milestone. </span>
                <span>When compared to the relatively finite number of possible variations available in </span>
                <span>the stacklight standard &ndash; where machine state is succinctly represented with nothing more than color, </span> 
                <span>position, and frequency &ndash; the main graphical interface on a production machine offers a wider landscape for </span>
                <span>competing design alternatives. Unfortunately, this flexibility often leads to haphazard designs where little to no </span>
                <span>consistency exists between machines. In many ways, the less complicated, yet more rigid, stacklight standard illustrates </span>
                <span>the ideal scope for use here in the graphical interface section. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0101] Considering the situational awareness model once again, we are reminded that an effective interface </span>
                <span>a) communicates the state of the world, b) affords insight into future conditions, and c) aids the </span>
                <span>operator's decision making process. The PackML stacklight offers situational awareness with incredible efficiency. </span>
                <span>A single flashing blue lamp, for example, is all that is needed to inform a remote line operator that 
                <span>an internal machine issue must be addressed. Ironically, it is the stacklight's inherent constraints </span>
                <span>that facilitate this situational awareness in such a usable manner. </span>
                <span>Despite the obvious limitations, a PackML stacklight is effectively a 4-pixel display, where: </span>
                <ul class="points">
                    <li>Each pixel has a fixed color; the blue pixel can only every be blue, and no other pixel may ever use that same color.</li>
                    <li>The pixels are aligned vertically so that their orientation is the same regardless of the operator's viewing angle.</li>
                    <li>Each pixel has a precise meaning that, once defined, does not change.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>These limitations and the resulting consistency are paramount to the stacklight's effectiveness. </span>                
            </p>
            <p>    
                <span>[0102] Carrying the analogy to the opposite extreme, the HMI terminal is nothing more than </span>
                <span>a 2-dimensional stacklight; it is reasonable to argue that the same benefits should be easily achieved. </span>
                <span>Unfortunately, the potential for chaos is far greater in the graphical domain. </span>
                <span>Whereas the stacklight's physical design provides natural hierarchy and content alignment, </span>
                <span>the graphical interface demands no such structure. Pixels are easily combined to form shapes </span>
                <span>and words that are arbitrarily sized and positioned on the display. These pixels quickly become </span>
                <span>rare commodities; there is always more content, never enough space. </span>
                <span>Content is then squeezed in here, crammed in there. Accordingly, a survey of machine </span>
                <span>interfaces in a typical production line will likely show little or no consistency in </span>
                <span>either content or alignment. Worse still, in a graphical interface, the </span>
                <span>content and alignment may very well change dynamically as the operator interacts with the screen. </span>
                <span>The HMI working group began their effort with these challenges in mind.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0103] From the earliest stages of the standardization effort, agreement existed that the graphical-interface </span>
                <span>portion of the PackML HMI standard would need to be narrowly focused. It was argued that </span>
                <span>the scope should be limited to the small intersection of operator-interface components that are </span>
                <span>most commonly encountered on production equipment; expanding standardization beyond this </span>
                <span>boundary would artificially limit designers and inhibit innovation. Moreover, since no single design </span>
                <span>will ever offer the perfect interface for all operators, the HMI working group decided to avoid a ground-up design effort </span>
                <span>and chose, instead, to consider the merits of a selected set of existing design alternatives; each </span>
                <span>either currently in use or proposed for use in a production line.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0104] In an effort to quantify the effectiveness of these sample interfaces, </span>
                <span>the group conducted a formal usability study, which aimed to produce an unbiased </span>
                <span>evaluation of the respective systems. The study presented participants with a </span>
                <span>collection of interfaces, each of which organized screen content in a unique </span>
                <span>and intriguing manner. Participants were challenged to demonstrate basic situational </span>
                <span>awareness by reporting system information available within each interface. </span>
                <span>Following these exercises, participants offered qualitative feedback on the respective designs, noting </span>
                <span>general preferences and providing comments on perceived usability. The study results and subsequent </span>
                <span>review by the committee left the originally expressed opinions on scope largely unchanged. </span>
                <span>While the standard HMI template would have a relatively limited scope, a supplementary collection </span>
                <span>of design guidelines would be provided to help designers produce more effective interfaces </span>
                <span>without inhibiting innovation.</span>
            </p>            
            <p>
                <span>[0105] Returning to the high-level HMI standardization goals &ndash; where </span>
                <span>the efficiency and effectiveness of line operators is the overarching priority &ndash; </span>
                <span>the effective transition from one interface to the next </span>
                <span>represents the primary benefit of the HMI template. This objective suggests </span>
                <span>that learnability, memorability, and efficiency are the key usability characteristics </span>
                <span>driving the template's design. Accordingly, it is reasonable to argue that the ideal </span>
                <span>template: a) follows expected conventions, b) maximizes consistency between machines, </span>
                <span>and c) ensures the operator feels they are in control. Given these criteria, the  </span>
                <span>standard PackML HMI template: </span>                
            </p>
            <ul class="points">
                <li>establishes a set of standard navigation elements</li>
                <li>specifies standard alignment and orientation patterns for these elements</li>
                <li>defines the auxiliary content operators rely on to make decisions in a production</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <span>[0106] The standard navigation elements represent the most frequently encountered </span>
                <span>menus and content groups found in production equipment. Following the best practices illustrated by the analysis of the stacklight </span>
                <span>design, each element is assigned a fixed position in the HMI's menu along with a </span>
                <span>standard name and icon representing the associated context. The template's alignment and </span>
                <span>orientation patterns are derived from the key findings of the usability study, which offered evidence  </span>
                <span>supporting established interface conventions from existing production HMIs. </span>
                <span>Concurrently, the study demonstrated that conventions employed in commercial products </span>
                <span>(e.g., mobile phones and tablets) do not map well to the production domain and should be avoided. </span>
                <span>These limitations are noted where appropriate. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0107] The following sections include numerous screenshots, which are provided to communicate </span>
                <span>the underlying standards and guidelines. Unless specifically noted, these screen designs </span>
                <span>(e.g., coloring, typography, layout) are offered solely as a means to communicate well established design principles. </span>
                <span>Interface design is a continuously evolving craft. While specific aesthetic design techniques quickly become passé, </span>
                <span>most of the underlying principles will persist long after the glimmer of the next fad is gone. </span>
                <span>Care has been taken to distinguish between design principles and artistic expression.</span>
                <span>When producing new designs it is important to evaluate the current state of interface design. </span>
                <span>While the screenshots were arguably "modern" when this standard was authored, we hope the standard's </span>
                <span>utility will outlive the provided examples; a design's effectiveness is not necessarily a function of its aesthetic quality. </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0109] The PackML HMI navigation standard includes: 1) a standard top-level menu including specific icons and labels, </span>
                <span>2) a pair of standard layout options for positioning of standard screen elements, and 3) a collection of common, </span>
                <span>yet optional, supplementary content. These standard HMI components offer the consistency operators need to move </span>
                <span>efficiently from machine to machine. </span>
                <span>The following sections illustrate the proper implementation of these components, while concurrently illustrating </span>

            <h3 id="NavigationStandardContexts">6.2.1 Navigation Contexts</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0110] The standard PackML navigation template includes seven primary contexts: </span>
                <span>a) Home, b) Products, c) Statistics, d) Settings, e) Alarms, f) Diagnostics, and g) Manual. </span>
                <span>These contexts represent the main conceptual groupings of content within production machines. </span>
                <span>The associated groupings have been derived from standard practice, and accommodate the most commonly encountered production-industry content. </span>
                <span>Each context is presented on the display with a standard icon representing the associated content. </span>
                <span>Likewise, each context includes a standard label, which describes the grouping. While the labels may </span>
                <span>be hidden if necessary (e.g., small screen displays), alternate labels should not be used. </span>
                <span>A brief description and example content for each of context is provided in Table 4. </span>

                <span>This menu, displaying the respective icons and labels, must be shown at all times. </span>
                <span>Navigation is initiated by selecting one of the available contexts (e.g., Home, Products, Statistics). </span>

                <span>intentionally outside of the scope of this standard, designs that introduces </span>

                <span>[0113] Examples A through C of Figure 35 illustrate the standard icons presented together to produce a variety of horizontal menu designs. </span>
                <span>In each example, Statistics is the active context. Example A demonstrates how modifications to the standard icons </span>

                <span>Example B offers an acceptable alternate style where only the active context <b>Statistics</b> is uniquely styled. </span>

                <span>The <b>Home</b> context, providing a high-level overview of the machine's </span>

                <span>that helps the operator quickly achieve situational awareness. For more </span>
                <span>complex machinery, this summary data may be best presented using a visual representation of the </span>
                <span>equipment where component-specific data overlays highlight key subsystems. Figure 36 offers an </span>
                <span>example "Machine View" that presents measured values and specified settings for segments of a filler machine. </span>

                <span>[0116] The simplest rendition of the Home icon should always be used. While no specific shape or "Home" form is required, </span>
                <span>an icon similar to that shown in Table 4 should be used. The operator's efforts to navigate through the system will be </span>
                <span>improved if their current navigation context is always easily determined. Accordingly, it is important that the actively selected context </span>
                <span>(i.e., the context associated with the screens they are currently viewing) can always be easily distinguished. </span>
                <span>Any styling applied to the Home icon should therefore also be applied to the remaining standard icons (e.g., Products, Settings). </span>
                <span>Additional adornments (e.g., circles, boxes, shading) may be incorrectly interpreted by the operator as an indication of their </span>
                <span>current navigation context. Such confusion can be avoided by eliminating those adornments from the graphical "language". </span>
                <span>As stated previously, the left-most icon in Figure 37 should not be used as the standard icon unless the remaining navigation icons follow the pattern </span>
                <span>and display a circle around the base image. It is, however, perfectly reasonable to use such an adornment as the indication </span>
                <span>of navigation context, in which case, one and only one icon would ever show the selected adornment. </span>

                <span>of durations (e.g., Settle Time, Vacuum Delay) necessary to properly affix the label to a specific product container. </span>
                <span>As these values are likely to be different from product to product, the interface should accommodate </span>
                <span>specification of the these values on a per-product basis. </span>
                <span>Settings that are applicable to all products (e.g., sensor positions) should be presented in the Settings context. </span>

                <span>on a palletizer, the term "Patterns" is appropriate as it represents the actual production process. </span>
                <span>If this alternate term is understood by operators and does not interfere with navigation it should be preferred over "Products". Other </span>
                <span>terms, specifically those inherited from the process domain (e.g., Recipe, Article, Formats, Package), </span>
                <span>should not be used. Alternate icons should, likewise, not be used. Figure 39 demonstrates common </span>
                <span>icon alternatives, including an icon that is too easily confused with a bar chart. As this shape conceptually aligns with the statistics context, </span>

                <span>Their perceived contrast has been limited by reducing their color saturation. Colors in the natural world </span>
                <span>help establish our perceived correlation between color saturation and proximity. Figure 57 shows a simple landscape </span>

                <span>ideal color for content with minimal importance. Given the white background of this document the grey dots have a low  </span>
                <span>level of contrast. In general, we reduce the perceived contrast of an item by lightening and reducing its level of saturation.</span>

                <span>[0142] In our array of dots, the highly saturated blue dots have focus, while the grey dots, despite being more numerous, </span>
                <span>fade to the background. We can employ these same techniques to appropriately balance the components of our interface. </span>
                <span>Recalling the characteristics of a "usable" interface, we must concurrently offer learnability and efficiency. </span>
                <span>We have already argued that contrast is necessary to get the operator's attention; in order to afford learnability, we must have contrast. </span>
                <span>However, once we have learned the interface, any excess contrast becomes a distraction reducing efficiency. If the contrast is overwhelming it does more harm than good. </span>
                <span>Figure 58 shows the numeric entry box from our Settings-screen example refactored to use a more appropriate level of contrast. </span>
                <span>Once the screen has been learned, the label "Duration" can fade to the background. We accommodate this </span>
                <span>by adjusting its size and darkness to reduce the percieved contrast. The same technique is applied to the units label. </span>
                <span>Units are merely presented to provide context for the associate value, which should be the primary focal point of the control. </span>
                <span>Accordingly, the emphasis on the units is also reduced; color and size are adjusted appropriately. </span>
                <span>Finally, the surrounding border, a signifier indicating that the element is clickable, has been likewise muted by reducing the stroke thickness </span>
                <span>and darkness. The resulting interface is still learnable without the excessive contrast that could </span>
                <span>serve as a distraction to the viewer. Along the way, it is reasonable to argue that the new box is also more aesthetically pleasing.</span>

            <p>
                <span>[0145] With the transition from physical buttons to touch screen displays, designers needed a way to communicate "clickability" </span>
                <span>to their operators. This was initially achieved by making the on-screen representation of a button look like a physical button. </span>
                <span>The aesthetic attributes used to communicate "clickability" are termed signifiers; they signify "clickability". Borders that highlight a clickable area </span>
                <span>are the most commonly encountered signifiers. Today, touchable interfaces are a staple of our daily lives. Accordingly, we are less </span>
                <span>reliant on the signfiers that were necessary during the transition from physical interfaces. Figure 61 shows a reasonable </span>
                <span>representation of the evolution of the on-screen button. </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0146] Gone are the button bezels that helped solidify the mental model for </span>

                <span>for icon-based buttons, the surrounding borders that illustrate the clickable area can be removed as well. While there is nothing </span>
                <span>wrong with the bordered button shown in the middle of Figure 61, the included border is "ink" that can be removed. The bare icon </span>
                <span>shown on the far right is self-sufficient, communicating "clickable" effectively and efficiently without a surrounding </span>

                <span>that operators will likely appreciate. </span>
                <span>As demonstrated in Figure 62, borders often require ancillary whitespace, which effectively reduces the usable screen area. </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0148] In general, we are seeking consistency in alignment; contrast in this dimension should be avoided. This consistency is most commonly achieved using </span>
                <span>grids, which align and distribute our screen elements effectively. While the characteristics of the underlying grid </span>
                <span>will vary from machine to machine based on required content and available screen space, the basic application of </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0149] The example in Figure 64 shows a 12-column grid; 10 and 12-column grids are frequently encountered, with </span>
                <span>most grid designs offering a column count that is divisible by 2 such that the screen can be split neatly in half to </span>
                <span>evenly accommodate larger content. In this example, 12 columns is a good compromise as the amount of content </span>
                <span>in the HMI would likely overwhelm a 10-column grid. The grid is constructed by first allocating some margin to the left and </span>
                <span>right sides of the screen; we don't want any content flush with the edge of our display. The remaining screen space is then </span>
                <span>divided up to produce the desired column count; gutters between the columns provide some breathing room for our content. </span>
                <span>While the number of columns is up to the designer, a grid that is too granular will accommodate the small variations in alignment </span>
                <span>that produced the disorienting dot-array shown earlier; keeping the column count reasonable (e.g., 12 columns) manages this problem.</span>
                <span>Figure 65 illustrates the grid design process.</span>
            </p>
            <figure>

                    <span>The remaining space is then split into a fixed number of columns, each separated by a small gutter.</span>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                <span>[0150] Once the grid is designed, content within the screen is simply aligned to the columns; Figure 66 demonstrates. </span>
                <span>The Statistics context label is aligned to the left-edge of the first column; likewise for the associated menu (i.e., Total, Hour, Interval, Batch). </span>
                <span>The SKU and the PackML Mode and States labels are aligned to the left edge of the third column. Where appropriate, </span>
                <span>extra margins within the columns can be used to provide extra space; consistency is the key. The grid </span>
                <span>is simply a guide for layout of the content. In this example, "Batch" is the currently selected menu </span>
                <span>within the Statistics context. The associated menu item is highlighted in light grey to provide focus. How wide should the </span>
                <span>highlighted region span? Simply align it to the grid and do so with all other menus to provide consistency </span>
                <span>between screens. As the design evolves, the grid design may need to be modified to accommodate the content.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>[0151] Some content will be center-aligned, other content will be right-aligned. Figure 67 demonstrates. </span>
                <span>In the figure, we see that the operator image is center-aligned to the 12th column. It could just as easily </span>
                <span>have been left or right-aligned to the column. Here, center-alignment offered a nice balance of whitespace between </span>
                <span>the text and the left-edge of the screen. The operator's name and time are right-aligned. Again, this is another </span>
                <span>decision left to the designer. The proximity between the name and image is minimal using right-alignment on the 11th </span>

                <span>With 8 elements and 12 columns, how do we align the content. Each element could be assigned a separate column, as shown in </span>
                <span>Figure 68, or the group can be arbitrarily spaced and centered across the full 12 columns, as shown in Figure 69. There really is no wrong answer here.</span>

                <span>[0153] Given the layout established in this standard, the preceding components (e.g., operator, menu, submenu, PackML status) will likely </span>

                <span>Utilizing the grid in a consistent manner will provide the desirable internal consistency discussed earlier. </span>
                <span>Our example Products and Settings screens offer a consistent feel because they utilize the same grid ratios. </span>
                <span>In Figure 70, we don't even need to illustrate the underlying 12-column grid; the consistency is clear without annotations. </span>
                <span>This consistency will likely be appreciated by the operator transitioning between these screens.</span>

                <span>it is understandable that some screens will be packed tightly with content. Careless use of white space aggravates this </span>

                <span>and there is white space between the respective groups. The extra borders introduced in Figure 74 are not required; </span>

                <span>that can now be corrected. First, the alignment is not consistent. The content in the Minor Faults </span>
                <span>section appears to be center aligned, whereas the content in the Processor and Major Faults sections </span>
                <span>appear left-aligned. Additionally, with the borders now removed, we more readily notice the black </span>
                <span>stroke around our fault LEDs. Also, curiously, the text in the Minor Faults section is larger than </span>
                <span>the text in the other sections. Finally, the alignment in the processor section adds lots of trapped </span>
                <span>negative space that can be improved. Figure 76 shows a redesign where these issues have been addressed. </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0159] In general, we prefer to keep related item close to each other (i.e., in close proximity). This reinforces the relationship between </span>
                <span>the items, and, helps ensure the operator can find them. In our earlier example, we showed that the operator's image and name </span>
                <span>were positioned in close proximity on the upper system tray. While minimally impactful, this same technique can be applied to our working </span>
                <span>example. Figure 77 shows our screen updated to move the Fault LEDs for better proximity to the associated labels. This change </span>
                <span>has the added benefit or releasing the trapped white space between the LEDs and labels.</span>

            <hr class="black" />
            <h3 id="DesignEvaluationBias">7.1 Overcoming Bias</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0146] As a design matures, it is essential to validate its usability. Again, we are discussing  </span>
                <span>more than traditional functional verification. Satisfying, Efficient, Learnable, Memorable, Tolerant: those are our objectives. </span>
                <span>An interface that makes sense to its designer is not complete until it has been vetted by another set of eyes. </span>
                <span>The designer's own "it looks good to me" assertion is not a sufficient form of validation. Even the well trained, well intentioned, </span>
                <span>designer will benefit from some form of supplementary design review. Why?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0147] We all suffer from bias. One that is particularly challenging &ndash; specifically for engineers </span>
                <span>functioning as designers &ndash; is the "curse of knowledge". Coined in Camerer, Loewenstein, and Weber (1989), </span>
                <span>the curse of knowledge is an inherent inability to see things from the target audience's perspective. </span>
                <span>The cause of this bias: experience. Despite daily dialogues and interactions with my operators, I simply cannot, with </span>
                <span>absolute certainty, speak on their behalf. I am not a production line operator. I am an engineer; I just see the world differently. </span>
                <span>While I empathize and focus on their unique usability requirements, I won't always make the right design decisions. </span>
                <span>I have seen behind the curtain. I understand the inner workings of my equipment at a level my operator's should never need to comprehend. </span>
                <span>There is a significant risk that my bias will bleed through; that I will design an interface that is suitable </span>
                <span>for an engineer, but unsatisfying for an operator. I am more likely to explain away what I feel are simply "quirks" in the interface, which, </span>
                <span>in the operator's eyes, are more serious usability issues.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0148] At the very least, I understand that this bias exists. I can use caution as I design; always </span>
                <span>mindful that my preferences may conflict with the operator's. On the opposite end of the spectrum, </span>
                <span>without such awareness or caution, bigger problems can occur. </span>
                <span>The curse of knowledge is responsible for those acronym filled error messages that are </span>
                <span>easily understood by the design engineer, but completely baffling for the operator using the system. The curse of </span>
                <span>knowledge helped hide that configuration parameter in the menu you only check after looking in five other places. Worse still, </span>
                <span>the next time you need that parameter, you may search in all those same wrong places again. </span>
                <span>I'm not a fool if I mistakenly check the drawer next to my stove every time I am looking for the </span>
                <span>potato masher. I am only a fool if I fail to move the masher to that drawer once I find it. The operator </span>
                <span>of a production device has no such luxury. That parameter they are looking for is forever stuck in the drawer the designer thought was "obviously" the </span>
                <span>right place. Is their interface functional? Yes. Is it satisfying for the operator? No. Is it efficient for the operator? No. To avoid this </span>
                <span>usability anti-pattern, the designer must do the leg work in advance to determine where the operator thinks that parameter should be. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0149] To make matters worse, the curse of knowledge grows with the design itself. As the designer </span>
                <span>molds their interface, they become enamored with its nuance and, unfortunately, comfortable with its flaws. Screens </span>
                <span>overflowing with content are easily interpreted by the designer that managed to squeeze yet another textbox into the </span>
                <span>display. Unfortunately, the result is likely overwhelming and completely frustrating to the production </span>
                <span>operator that is tasked with increasing throughput to hit a quota late in their production shift.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0150] Fortunately, the cure for this bias is simple; it's humility. Kleon (2012) offered a list of important characteristics </span>
                <span>that all "artists" should have. As an engineer studying design, I felt that "a willingness to look stupid" was the </span>
                <span>key. The arrogant engineer, so proud of his work, releases it without the validation it needs. I've been there. </span>
                <span>"Wow, that looks cool... ship it." I shiver a bit when I think about the designs I've shipped without ever putting them </span>
                <span>in front of an actual operator. Maybe it's not arrogance. Maybe it is just an unwillingness to look stupid. </span>
                <span>The mantra of usability design brought forward a new mindset for me. If the operator cannot use my interface, whose fault is it? Mine? Wait... what?</span>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0151] Balancing display density, information architecture, and aesthetic design is an iterative process. </span>
                <span>Getting these right the first time is not just challenging, it's unlikely. It doesn't matter how smart you are, </span>
                <span>or what degrees you have. So, as designers, we often cheat; we need to. We look at existing designs </span>
                <span>that resonate with us. We model our interfaces after those we find impressive. We figure we will get </span>
                <span>further faster if we don't reinvent the wheel. Kleon argued just this point, offering the perfect inspiration </span>
                <span>for those who are aren't "artists", but are tasked with creating "art". The secret, he argued: steal stuff, then make </span>
                <span>it your own. While I absolutely agree with this thinking &ndash; all of my best ideas are someone elses &ndash; </span>
                <span>there are a few risks to keep in mind.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0152] First, going back to the previous point, I am not an operator. If I find something "intriguing" does that mean my </span>
                <span>operators will as well? Moreover, will it help them be more effective as an operator? Or will I simply burden them with some </span>
                <span>clunky widget &ndash; like a talking paperclip &ndash; </span>
                <span>that they will just find annoying? Engineers armed with a fancy graphical control library are more likely to gold-plate their interfaces. </span>
                <span>That 15-slice 3D pie chart, with the fancy animation, is not the best tool to communicate with an </span>
                <span>an operator. Such tools often impress interface designers without offering their operators any actual benefit. </span>
                <span>On the contrary, these interfaces make it more difficult to interpret the data, which leads to poor situational awareness and </span>
                <span>misguided decisions.</span>
            </p> 
            <p>
                <span>[0153] The second risk, which doesn't necessarily apply to the traditional artist, </span>
                <span>is the nature of our domain. Poor design in our world costs money. </span>
                <span>An artist grows through creativity; the more carefree the better. An artist cannot be held back by fear. </span>
                <span>They must take risks; their growth depends on it. They share their work with others openly. They crave the feedback of their peers. </span>
                <span>That is the humility Kleon described. As engineers, however, our instincts tell us we must get it right the first </span>
                <span>time. So, if </span>
                <span>we are going to "steal" ideas for our production equipment, it's probably </span>
                <span>a good idea to pull insight from companies that have an impressive track record of great design; like Apple. </span>
                <span>Consider, however, the early versions of Apple's Health App demonstrated in Figure 51. Interesting? Sure. Do I want to force my operators </span>
                <span>to stare at this all day? Certainly not. We must steal with care. Context is important. That Health App was not </span>
                <span>designed for use on a piece of industrial equipment. It is not suitable for our domain.</span>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img id="alignment" src="images/StealWithCare.png" />
                <figcaption>
                    <span>Figure 51: The early Apple Health App used highly saturated colors paired with superfluous gradients. The result suffered from reduced legibility </span>
                    <span>that would likely cripple an production device.</span>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                <span>[0154] It is important that we design with the creativity of an artist, while accommodating the risks </span>
                <span>brought on by the curse of knowledge and the requirements of our domain. We want to produce  To do this, we must rely on others to review our work; that is where humility steps in. </span>
                <span>Our discussion thus far suggests that this is not a simple task. Is it sufficient to simply ask other engineers their opinion? Probably not. </span>
                <span>Are they operators? Are they graphic designers? Are they impervious to the curse of knowledge? Is the operator at the forefront of their mind? </span>
                <span>Ideally, we need to put our designs in front of actual operators. Should we do that with our first draft? </span>
                <span>Then, they too, will have the curse of knowledge. We will have introduced bias; expectation. They cannot see an </span>
                <span>interface for the first time ever again. Flaws you intend to fix in the future can spoil their first impression. </span>
                <span>We will have wasted our best chance to actually measure one of our core usability qualities: learnability. </span>
            </p>
                <span>[0155] There are plenty of potential pitfalls at the evaluation stage. We will  </span>

                <span>"low-cost", validation technique. Critique is simply  contrast. In this example color is used to highlight </span>
                <span>The scope of this guidance's standard is quite narrow. </span>

                <span>[0156] </span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="DesignEvaluationCritique">7.1 Critique</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0157] As a design matures, it is important to perform some form of validation. Again, we argue that, </span>
                <span>functional is not sufficient. A design that makes sense to the designer is not complete until is has been vetted in some way. </span>
                <span>The designer's "it looks good to me" opinion is not a sufficient form of validation. For each evaluation technique, the level </span>
                <span>of formality can scale to accommodate the nature of the design. Critique, the first evaluation method </span>
                <span>we will discuss, is the perfect example of a casual, "low-cost", validation technique. Critique is simply  </span>
                <span>contrast. In this example color is used to highlight the element. This simple change of color produces </span>
