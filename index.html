            <hr class="black" />
            <h3 id="Purpose">2.1 Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0002] It is generally accepted that production lines with widely varying HMI designs </span>
                <span>will suffer from reduced operator efficiency, which </span>
                <span>will likely lead to longer downtime events, lower throughput, and reduced job satisfaction. </span>
                <span>To help counter these issues, the following guidance will establish a set of Human-Machine </span>
                <span>Interface implementation standards that, when employed by production machinery designers, </span>
                <span>will establish the consistency necessary to accommodate the specific needs of the production-line operator.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0003] In addition to the standards established in this document, the guidance will communicate </span>
                <span>a collection of more generic interface design best practices. We argue that the general level of </span>
                <span>usability within machine HMIs can always be improved. Accordingly, this document will provide </span>
                <span>guidance in the areas of usability and graphic design, which should benefit design engineers </span>
                <span>seeking to expand their background in those disciplines. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0004] To accompany the recommendations offered throughout, this guideline presents a collection </span>
                <span>of reference material from which many of the best practices have been established. Readers are </span>
                <span>encouraged to explore these references, particularly those that fall outside the scope of </span>
                <span>their primary discipline. Throughout, an underlying theme will become evident; </span>
                <span>the designer is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the operator. Put bluntly, the </span>
                <span>operator's inability to comprehend or effectively use an interface is the fault of the designer. Errors </span>
                <span>incurred due to flawed design are not the responsibility of the operator, but are instead, </span>
                <span>evidence of a failure on the part of the designer. It is our expectation that readers of </span>
                <span>this guidance are willing to accept that responsibility and do their best to optimize </span>
                <span>their operator's experience.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0005] Success in the above endeavor, however, is not possible if designers work in isolation. </span>
                <span>Designers must collaborate with operators to understand their goals and the environment </span>
                <span>in which they work. Additionally, designers must collaborate with their peers to examine their work </span>
                <span>with a critical eye and to better understand successful designs and the underlying mechanisms that </span>
                <span>help achieve the desired outcome. The recommendations provided here advocate these additional steps, as </span>
                <span>they are essential to the development of optimally usable designs.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="Goals">2.2 Goals</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0006] As stated previously, this guidance is targeted at designers for the benefit of operators. </span>
                <span>By improving the environment in which operators work, producers will ideally realize </span>
                <span>reductions in downtime, increased throughput, lower levels of rework, and operators with higher </span>
                <span>levels of job satisfaction. Moreover, standardization in specific areas of the human-machine interface </span>
                <span>should aid in the development of cross-functional production operators that can move from line to </span>
                <span>line with greater efficiency.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0007] The best practices offered throughout are provided to encourage continuous improvement on </span>
                <span>the part of system designers. Our ability to effectively communicate with the operators </span>
                <span>through the equipment we design can always be improved. The provided guidance is </span>
                <span>simply a starting point for designers seeking additional exposure to the usability and graphic </span>
                <span>design disciplines. Proper application of the provided recommendations is ultimately dependent on the context in question; </span>
                <span>evaluating the resulting designs via operator testing is essential. Getting it right the first time is a lofty goal, but </span>
                <span>getting it right is paramount. With a greater understanding and ability to control the way operators </span>
                <span>experience the equipment, it is expected that the designers will likewise experience </span>
                <span>greater job satisfaction.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="GuidanceStructure">2.3 Guidance Structure</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0008] Given the previously stated purpose and goals, the remainder of this guidance will be structured to </span>
                <span>provide a mix of content including (a) the standard specifications, (b) the supporting background content, and </span>
                <span> (c) related best practices. Section 3 begins by offering a basic summary of usability concepts and principles. The </span>
                <span>provided background material establishes the foundation upon which the remaining best practices will follow. Related topics include: </span>
                <span>(a) the important characteristics of the production operator, (b) the universally accepted characteristics of usability, </span>
                <span>and (c) a summary of the models that represent situation awareness and decision making. </span>
            </p>

                <span>[0009] The presentation of the HMI standards will begin in section 4 where the Stacklight standard is specified. </span>
                <span>That section, and the subsequent sections covering the standards for state models and navigation systems, will specify </span>
                <span>the associated standard before shifting to supplemental content provided to map the presented  </span>
                <span>standards back to the established usability principles. Those specifically interested in the Stacklight </span>
                <span>standard specification, for example, can focus exclusively on section 4.2, which presents the standard itself. The remaining content in section 4 will </span>
                <span>then focus on the underlying usability principles and best practices that we feel are most relevant to effective stacklight design. While we </span>
                <span>expect this usability content will be beneficial to all readers, it is understood that the standard specifications will likely  </span>
                <span>take precedence in many instances. </span>

                <p>
                    <span>[0011] In order to appropriately design machines that will ultimately meet the needs of the operator, </span>
                    <span>we must first establish the characteristics that are critical to success.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0012] The first relevant operational aspect to be taken into consideration is that the operator responsible for multiple </span>
                    <span>machines does not simply stand by and monitor a single HMI. Therefore, when a downtime event is triggered by a  </span>
                    <span>specific machine in a complex line, it is highly likely that the operator is not present. Accordingly, effective communication  </span>
                    <span>with an operator that arrives after the occurrence of a critical event will prove to be an essential skill. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0013] The downtime example is further complicated by the urgency of the situation. While poor design is more easily </span>
                    <span>accommodated under normal operating conditions, a downtime event introduces additional stress on the operator. It </span>
                    <span>is reasonable to argue that the likelihood of interface-manipulation errors will increase under this additional urgency. </span>
                    <span>Abnormal operating conditions clearly amplify the impact of flawed design. Accordingly, </span>
                    <span>the designer must take care to consider both the environment and conditions under which the operators perform.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0014] The associated goals and context in which operators work should be in the forefront of the designer's mind </span>
                    <span>as each HMI decision is made. Understanding and empathizing with the operator is a great motivator for </span>
                    <span>the engaged designer.</span>
                </p>
                <h3 id="UsabilityCharacteristics">3.2 Usability Characteristics</h3>
                <p>
                    <span>[0015] With a handful of critical operator characteristics understood, it is next important to establish the scope </span>
                    <span>of the term usability. Nielsen (1993) presents a set of usability characteristics to help clarify the concept; the </span>
                    <span>usability of a machine is a function of its (a) Learnability, (b) Memorability, (c) Efficiency, (d) Fault Resistance </span>
                    <span>and Tolerance, and (e) the level of Satisfaction experienced by the operator.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0016] Within the scope of production environments, system learnability is most relevant for operators interacting with a piece of </span>
                    <span>equipment for the first time. Here, the operator's ability to quickly build fluency in the associated machine interface is a key measure </span>
                    <span>of the designer's success. Similarly, an operator's ability to become productive when transitioning from one </span>
                    <span>machine to another is a function of the latter machine's level of learnability; standardization is a big help in this scenario.  </span>
                    <span>It is important to note, however, that expert users (i.e., those executing advanced functionality) will still require </span>
                    <span>specialized training and significant practice before they are able to effectively perform certain higher-level </span>
                    <span>tasks. This is completely acceptable; the learnability characteristic is simply not applicable in these </span>
                    <span>cases. Learnability optimizations are generally not a substitute for proper training and practice. Design techniques like </span>
                    <span>Progressive Disclosure help illustrate this distinction. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0017] Most easily demonstrated by examining the design of digital printing interfaces, progressive disclosure is a technique </span>
                    <span>whereby expert-level controls and interfaces are segregated from the components that are most frequently utilized. In a typical </span>
                    <span>printer interface, a small number of core facilities (e.g., number of copies, page selection, orientation) are presented in simple dialogs similar to that shown in Figure 1, </span>
                    <span>while more advanced features (e.g., color management, page setup) are hidden in "Advanced" submenus. </span>
                    <span>This separation optimizes the basic interface, providing an environment that is less likely to overwhelm the average user. </span>
                    <span>Accordingly, this technique presents an interface that is highly learnable. The number of options are minimized, leaving a smaller subset of features that must be learned. </span>
                    <span>Expert users instead utilize a separate section of the interface that is dedicated to their more specialized </span>
                    <span>needs. Improving the efficiency for the expert user by mixing more complicated features with basic tools would </span>
                    <span>complicate the interface to the disadvantage of the average user. This should be avoided. Isolating the advanced features is </span>
                    <span>the appropriate design compromise in most situations where mixed audiences exist. </span>
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img id="print-dialog" src="images/print.png" />
                    <figcaption>
                        <span>Figure 1: Print dialogs typically hide expert-level controls behind "Advanced settings" shortcuts that offer interfaces more suitable </span>
                        <span>for the advanced audience. With the advanced features hidden away, the resulting basic interface is simpler and easier to learn. This design </span>
                        <span>concept is known as progressive disclosure; additional content is presented in levels appropriate to the audience. </span>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    <span>[0018] Learnability is generally measured by presenting new users with an interface-based task. </span>
                    <span>The time required to complete the task is then a reasonable quantitative metric of the system's learnability. When compared to either an </span>
                    <span>existing design or a competing design alternative, the magnitude of the improvement attributed to the new design will help validate the underlying concept. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0019] In a well-functioning production line, it is likely that an operator will have infrequent interactions </span>
                    <span>with the HMI. When the operator returns to a machine after a prolonged absence, the memorability of </span>
                    <span>the HMI becomes the focal point. Will the operator need to relearn the interface or is there some level of </span>
                    <span>retention that allows a returning user to become productive more quickly than a new user? </span>
                    <span>Testing memorability is generally more difficult than testing learnability as some period of inactivity is required </span>
                    <span>to properly evaluate how effectively the interface accommodates the returning operator. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0020] Maintaining the downtime example discussed previously, an operator's ability to quickly identify and </span>
                    <span>resolve an event is a perfect demonstration of the Efficiency characteristic. If instead, the operator must struggle </span>
                    <span>through multiple steps with uncertainty and confusion, the downtime event will likely persist for an </span>
                    <span>unacceptable period. When considered as raw metrics, the efficiency of a production machine is best </span>
                    <span>characterized in terms of the time necessary to complete specific tasks; OEE is rooted in such thinking. While it is often argued that the </span>
                    <span>number of steps taken (e.g., taps, key presses) is a worthwhile metric, we argue that a single step that </span>
                    <span>takes 5 minutes due to operator uncertainty is much less efficient than 50 steps that require minimal </span>
                    <span>thought and take a total of 10 seconds to complete. While lowering the number of required steps is a worthy objective, time </span>
                    <span>to completion is usually the more important goal in production environments. Measuring efficiency often </span>
                    <span>warrants some amount of task repetition. During such testing, the first few iterations will actually </span>
                    <span>constitute a measure of learnability. Once the task is learned, a more accurate measure of efficiency </span>
                    <span>can be achieved through a number of additional repetitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0021] Efficiency can often be improved through the addition of shortcuts that simplify frequently used interactions. </span>
                    <span>Standard multi-step operations (e.g., menu navigation or command sequences) can be optimized in ways that </span>
                    <span>benefit advanced users without interfering with novice operators. On-screen touch shortcuts, for example, </span>
                    <span>accelerate the efforts of expert users without cluttering the interface with additional content. While the novice user is still able to </span>
                    <span>employ the standard mechanism, the expert user achieves the same result with fewer steps. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0022] Likewise, a system that helps operators avoid errors will likely pay dividends in both the efficiency and </span>
                    <span>satisfaction categories. Extra, unnecessary HMI steps performed due to uncertainty on the part of </span>
                    <span>the operator are a prime example of waste when considered from the lean manufacturing viewpoint. </span>
                    <span>Producing designs that minimize such waste accommodate the Fault Resistance objective. Moreover, </span>
                    <span>a system that can efficiently resolve slips or mistakes (e.g., undo to recover from accidentally </span>
                    <span>deleting a product configuration) warrants additional points in the fault tolerance category. Facilities </span>
                    <span>that accommodate fault tolerance will generally improve efficiency and overall operator satisfaction as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0023] While the Learnability, Memorability, Efficiency, and Fault Awareness characteristics are well </span>
                    <span>aligned with quantitative metrics, the Satisfaction characteristic is much more qualitative in </span>
                    <span>nature. The subjective opinions of the operator can be difficult to accommodate. Designing a </span>
                    <span>satisfying interface generally requires (a) a good understanding of the operator, (b) an understanding of the context </span>
                    <span>of use, and (c) an understanding of the operator's goals. When the operator and the associated work environment are at </span>
                    <span>the forefront of the designer's mind, they will be better able to comprehend the subjective envelope of satisfaction. </span>
                    <span>With that understanding in place, proper application of basic design principles will likely yield an interface that is satisfying. </span>
                </p>
                <h3 id="SituationAwareness">3.3 Situational Awareness</h3>
                <p>
                    <span>[0024] Given the previously discussed usability characteristics, it is next necessary to consider how a </span>
                    <span>given machine can effectively (a) communicate a condition and (b) direct the operator to the appropriate </span>
                    <span>course of action. Endsley (1995) offers a model for Situation Awareness (SA) that breaks such interactions </span>
                    <span>into three distinct levels. First, the model declares that the operator must perceive a given condition. The associated stimulus could be </span>
                    <span>a horn, a stacklight, a message on a display, a pile of products on the production floor, or </span>
                    <span>the smell of burning plastic. Having achieved Level 1 SA, the operator must then appropriately </span>
                    <span>interpret the situation. What does the light mean? Why are there items on the floor? What's that </span>
                    <span>smell? Finally, after Level 2 SA is achieved, the operator must project the current situation into the future. Perhaps the light </span>
                    <span>is only a warning indicator that requires action to prevent a less desirable outcome. At this stage, </span>
                    <span>the operator has achieved Level 3 SA and must make a decision and, optionally, perform some course of action. </span>
                    <span>Ideally, the achieved level of awareness is not flawed and contains no level of uncertainty. The appropriateness of the operator's response </span>
                    <span>is contingent on the effectiveness at each subsequent awareness level. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0025] Ultimately, the designer is responsible for ensuring that the situational awareness is not flawed and contains </span>
                    <span>minimal uncertainty. If the operator does not perceive the light because it is obscured from </span>
                    <span>their vantage point, they have no reason to consider its meaning. Or, perhaps, a horn from a </span>
                    <span>different line distracted their attention. Ensuring that the stimulus is effectively perceived </span>
                    <span>is the first challenge. Design principles offered throughout this guidance focus specifically on effective communication. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0026] Comprehension of the situation with respect to the operator's goals is the next challenge. Given </span>
                    <span>a fully integrated production line and a standard stacklight convention, the operator will be </span>
                    <span>responsible for monitoring the lights on the entire production line. If the operator observes a light </span>
                    <span>transition from green to blue, the operator must interpret that light transition both in the context </span>
                    <span>of the individual machine, and in relationship to the other machines on the line. Once both the </span>
                    <span>observation and comprehension are achieved, the operator will determine, for example, that the </span>
                    <span>wrapping machine is running low on film. Having made this determination, the operator will consider </span>
                    <span>the level 3 SA needs, which address how the current conditions will impact the future status </span>
                    <span>of the line.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0027] Continuing the example of the machine running low on film, the operator will likely consider how </span>
                    <span>urgent the situation is. If the operator understands that an additional 15 minutes of production can be expected following the </span>
                    <span>first instance of an alarm, the operator will consider this point when making a decision on a course of action. </span>
                    <span>Perhaps there is sufficient time to complete another task before addressing the active alarm. </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>[0028] Understanding this basic model of situation awareness is a great benefit to designers. By </span>
                    <span>understanding the basic thought process of the operator, and the relevant levels therein, </span>
                    <span>the designer is left with only a few basic questions when evaluating a design. Will the </span>
                    <span>operator see the stimulus I have designed? If the stimulus is provided on screen, is the </span>
                    <span>intended focal point sufficiently salient, or is there other "digital noise" distracting </span>
                    <span>the operator's attention from the critical indicator? Will the operator comprehend the feedback </span>
                    <span>from the machine, or is the signal ambiguous, leaving the operator with a high level of </span>
                    <span>uncertainty? Finally, does the machine simplify the operator's ability to predict the future </span>
                    <span>outcome? Does the system warrant an explicit message communicating the time remaining until a </span>
                    <span>critical system stoppage? This would certainly help the inexperienced operator that does not </span>
                    <span>yet understand the relationship between system events. When considering the appropriateness of the design, the designer </span>
                    <span>can utilize the situational awareness model to help direct and evaluate potential solutions.</span>
                </p>

                    <span>in each aspect of its design. Once these concepts are considered in the simple context of </span>
                    <span>stacklights, we will continue to explore the more complicated user-interface design domain.</span>

                <span>naturally constrained to a simple ordered collection of colored lamps </span>
                <span>illuminated in a specific manner based on the machine state, </span>
                <span>the graphical display portion of the HMI affords the designer a more limitless </span>
                <span>range of options, which, unfortunately, offers endless opportunities </span>
                <span>for the introduction of usability issues. The same simple principles that are inherent in </span>
                <span>the effective design of stacklights and control push-buttons will demonstrate the foundation </span>
                <span>of usability in the graphical interface. Discussing these principles in the </span>
                <span>more tangible context of stacklights and push-buttons may at first seem </span>
                <span>excessive, but, as we will discover, the design principles that produce optimal </span>
                <span>usability are quite simple and intuitive once they are understood and embraced. </span>
                <span>When applied to the graphical portion of the HMI, these principles will improve </span>
                <span>system usability while requiring minimal effort on the part of the designer.</span>

                <span>be illuminated in a specific sequence (i.e., off, solid, or flashing) based on the current PackML state. The </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0034] The associated standard PackML implementation for push-button controls (e.g., start, stop, reset) follows </span>
                <span>conventions similar to those defined for stacklights. While adhering to the basic </span>
                <span>color and marking requirements for push-buttons specified in IEC 60204-1:2016, the PackML </span>
                <span>standard requires that illuminated push-button actuators use the sequence mapping detailed in Figure 3 and Table 2. </span>
                <span>The Reset and Start buttons will flash to communicate that the operator must press the respective button to initiate </span>
                <span>a transition to the subsequent PackML state (i.e., Clearing, Resetting, Starting). Illuminating the Stop button is not  </span>
                <span>required. Also, note that the flashing-green Start button is aligned exclusively with the flashing-green lamp, </span>
                <span>but that a similar perfect correlation does not exist for the Running condition (i.e., solid-green lamp and solid Start button). </span>
                <span>Moreover, note that there is no relationship between the blue lamp and the traditionally blue Reset button. </span>
            </p>            
            <p>
                <span>[0035] The underlying state transitions associated with the push-button controls align specifically with the Clear, Reset, Start, </span>
                <span>and Stop commands defined in the PackML state model. The Start and Stop buttons trigger the associated Start </span>
                <span>and Stop commands, whereas the Clear and Reset commands are both associated with the Reset button. </span>
                <span>The implementation of the Reset push-button sequencing (i.e., off, flashing, or solid) will be applied in an appropriate </span>
                <span>device-specific manner. Following an emergency stop, for example, the system will transition to the Aborted state where an </span>
                <span>operator-initiated press of the Reset button is likely necessary to trigger the transition to the Clearing state. Similarly, </span>
                <span>an open door may trigger the Stop command, which will </span>
                <span>send the machine to the Stopped state where the Reset command is required. If an operator-initiated Reset is required in this </span>
                <span>scenario, the Reset button must flash. Note that the path from Aborted </span>
                <span>to Idle (i.e., the path through Clearing and Stopped) requires both a Clear and Reset command, both of which will be mapped to  </span>
                <span>the flashing Reset button. For machines where the full Aborted-to-Idle path can be traversed safely, a single-press reset </span>
                <span>is permitted. For machines where an operator-initiated reset is not required, the flashing Reset button is likewise not required. </span>
                <span>In short, whenever an operator-initiated reset is required, the Reset button must flash. </span>

                <span>of the lamp and push-button light sequences. In the Stopped state, the red lamp will be solid </span>
                <span>and  &ndash; if an operator-initiated reset is required &ndash; the Reset button  </span>
                <span>will be flashing. When the Reset button is pressed, the system will transition </span>
                <span>through Resetting to the Idle state, where the Start button and green lamp will begin flashing. </span>
                <span>Upon a press of the Start button, the green lamp and Start </span>
                <span>button will display solid through the Starting state to the Execute state.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0037] When the Stop button is pressed, the green lamp will turn off and the red lamp will </span>

                <span>will again return to a flashing sequence if an operator-initiated Reset action is required. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0038] Alternately, from the Execute state, for example, the system will transition to the </span>
                <span>Aborting state when the E-Stop is engaged. On this transition, the red lamp </span>
                <span>will begin flashing. When the system reaches the Aborted state, the Reset button will begin flashing. </span>
                <span>Once the E-Stop is cleared and the Reset button is pressed, the system will transition through the </span>
                <span>Clearing state until the transition to the Stopped state completes, where the red lamp will light solid. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0039] The sequence demonstrated in diagram Figure 5 will execute on systems that employ the Completing transition. </span>
                <span>The Complete command will initiate the sequence sending the machine through the Completing state where the green </span>
                <span>lamp will remain on and the Start button will remain illuminated. When the Complete state is reached, the green </span>
                <span>lamp will clear and the red lamp will light. At this point, the Start button will clear and the Reset button will </span>
                <span>begin flashing. This condition matches the equivalent response that occurs when the system reaches the Stopped </span>
                <span>state presented as the entry point in Figure 5.</span>

                <span>[0042] The blue lamp will also be utilized to communicate required preventative measures </span>
                <span>for any internal conditions that would prevent proper machine operation and an associated transition to the Held state. </span>
                <span>For example, should the machine determine that its local material store is critically low, this condition </span>
                <span>will be communicated to the operator by flashing the blue lamp. The operator will then have </span>
                <span>a set period of time to replenish the material store before the machine reaches the Held condition, </span>
                <span>which indicates that material has been exhausted to the point where production can no longer proceed. </span>
                <span>As demonstrated in Figure 8, the flashing blue lamp will accompany a second lamp, which indicates the </span>
                <span>current machine state. The lamps will be lit simultaneously to communicate the Hold warning and the active machine state. </span>
                <span>If the Held state is reached, the blue lamp will then be lit solid where is will stay until the material </span>
                <span>is restored to an adequate level. </span>

            <h3 id="StacklightsHierarchy">4.3 Hierarchy, Orientation, Consistency, and Convention</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0043] Given the associated PackML states, the top-down orientation </span>
                <span>of the lights follows western cultural conventions where the </span>
                <span>most critical elements are positioned at the top. This cultural convention is evident </span>
                <span>in the indicator light descriptions of IEC 60204-1:2016, from which  </span>
                <span>this PackML stacklight standard is derived. Here, the </span>
                <span>Stopped and Aborted states are presented at the top of the </span>
                <span>stacklight, communicating their importance through their color </span>
                <span>(e.g., red or amber) and, perhaps more importantly, their </span>
                <span>position. The sequence attribute (i.e., flashing or solid) </span>
                <span>further communicates the urgency of the current state. It is </span>
                <span>accepted that the flashing light will draw more attention than a </span>
                <span>solid light, therefore, the flashing sequence is associated with </span>
                <span>the more urgent PackML states (e.g., Aborted is more urgent than </span>
                <span>Stopped). Note specifically here, that a machine approaching a Held </span>
                <span>condition (e.g., material low), is considered more critical than </span>
                <span>a machine that is actively held. Together, the attributes of color, position, and sequence </span>
                <span>represent hierarchy within the state model. Lights in a higher </span>
                <span>position are more urgent than those in a lower position, while </span>
                <span>lights that are flashing are more urgent than those that are </span>
                <span>solid. Similarly, through cultural convention, red is more urgent </span>
                <span>than amber. Keep culture in mind when designing as these conventions </span>
                <span>may not hold in all contexts. Hierarchy in the graphical interface will utilize </span>
                <span>these same attributes, as well as others, to establish focus, </span>
                <span>guiding the operator's attention to elements that are most </span>
                <span>essential to the task at hand.</span>
            </p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>
                <span>[0044] Given this summary, a key requirement of the proper application of the </span>
                <span>PackML stacklight standard is an adherence to the specified light </span>
                <span>orientation. Across a given production line, it is essential that the order </span>
                <span>of the lights maintain the top-down orientation shown in Figure 9. While the dual </span>
                <span>coding (i.e., color and position) within the standard would likely accommodate </span>
                <span>a mispositioned light (e.g., amber above red), such a violation would surely </span>
                <span>be a distraction to a line operator. It is expected that a focused color-sighted </span>
                <span>line operator could overcome a violation of the light position standard. However, </span>
                <span>under the additional stress of a line stoppage, a simple lack of consistency in </span>
                <span>stacklight orientation could lead to an extended stoppage. Accordingly, we will </span>
                <span>highlight consistency in orientation as a key usability principle, one that will </span>
                <span>be revisited in the discussion on navigation design.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0045] Moreover, it is essential that the color and sequence attributes of the </span>
                <span>associated stacklights be implemented in a consistent fashion within a single </span>
                <span>production facility. While an operator will most likely overcome some level of </span>
                <span>inconsistency in the size or color of the red stacklights across a number of </span>
                <span>machines in a single production line, a deviation in the frequency of a flashing </span>
                <span>light could draw undue attention to a single machine. A machine stacklight </span>
                <span>flashing at a higher rate will draw more attention than surrounding machines </span>
                <span>blinking at a lower rate. Such scenarios should be avoided by establishing a </span>
                <span>standard flashing frequency within the line.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0046] These points illustrate the relevant distinction between internal and external consistency. </span>
                <span>Utilizing the same size and shape lenses within a single stacklight of a given machine </span>
                <span>demonstrates the most basic application of internal consistency. A lack of consistency in a </span>
                <span>single light of the stack &ndash; a different shape or size, for example &ndash; would draw </span>
                <span>additional attention from the operator. This should be avoided unless the additional attention </span>
                <span>is a desirable effect. External consistency, on the other hand, is demonstrated by using the same </span>
                <span>top-down sequence of colors in the PackML stacklights across a production line containing </span>
                <span>machines produced by multiple vendors. When we discuss standardization, external consistency </span>
                <span>is generally the objective as it accommodates consistency across facilities and organizations. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0047] An additional application of consistency evident throughout this design </span>
                <span>is the requirement that at all times at least one of the lamps will be illuminated. This </span>
                <span>requirement helps eliminate uncertainty on the part of the operator. The absence of an </span>
                <span>active lamp could lead the operator to believe that the machine is either off or malfunctioning for some reason. </span>
                <span>Keeping at least one lamp illuminated at all times is an important communication mechanism. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0048] Finally, while not explicitly discussed in IEC 60204-1:2009, external consistency (i.e., across machines) </span>
                <span>with respect to the relative orientation of the push-button controls for Start, Stop, and Reset </span>
                <span>is highly recommended. As with the stacklight example &ndash; where color and </span>
                <span>position combine to communicate state &ndash; the dual coding of marking and positioning of push-buttons </span>
                <span>reduces the likelihood of error on the part of the operator. However, consider the impact of two </span>
                <span>adjacent machines where the orientation of the Start and Stop buttons are reversed. While </span>
                <span>inconsistency in orientation should be avoided if possible, the optional introduction of color </span>
                <span>can aid the operator when positional consistency cannot be guaranteed.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="StacklightsAlignment">4.4 Alignment</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0049] While it is likely taken for granted in the design of stacklights, alignment </span>
                <span>is a key component of usability. Operators will conceptually group items that are </span>
                <span>aligned with one another. The vertical alignment of the stacklights communicates this relationship. </span>
                <span>Accordingly, it is important to align components that are related; the alignment reinforces the </span>
                <span>relationship for the operator. Conversely, it is equally important </span>
                <span>to avoid aligning components that are unrelated, particularly if an assumed association could increase </span>
                <span>the likelihood of operator confusion or error. Lamps that serve some purpose other than communicating </span>
                <span>PackML state should be positioned on a separate stack to achieve alignment isolation, which will help avoid distraction and confusion. </span>
            </p>

            <h3 id="StacklightsProximity">4.5 Proximity</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0050] Given the importance of the orientation and alignment principles, it is equally important that </span>
                <span>the PackML stacklights and push-button controls be positioned in a manner that ensures safe operation and effectively communicates </span>
                <span>the respective association with a given machine. While operator visibility is a key </span>
                <span>requirement for effective positioning, a stacklight that is not sufficiently </span>
                <span>positioned with respect to the machine could fail to effectively communicate </span>
                <span>the PackML state. Moreover, a PackML stacklight that is not consistently positioned </span>
                <span>within the relative body of the associated machine may not be appropriately identified </span>
                <span>if multiple stacklights with similar colors are present within the machine's proximity. </span>
                <span>Accordingly, it is recommended that the PackML stacklights be positioned such that a </span>
                <span>line operator with a view of the production line can consistently identify the PackML </span>
                <span>stacklights for each machine and correctly interpret the machine responsible for a </span>
                <span>line stoppage or hold event. Stacklights for other machines should be positioned with </span>
                <span>sufficient separation to ensure their status is not misplaced. Additionally, as safety is paramount, the </span>
                <span>proximity of push-buttons must be managed to ensure that operators have clear visibility </span>
                <span>of the associated machine whenever the Start button is pressed. </span>
            </p>

            <h3 id="StacklightsContrast">4.6 Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0051] The discussions of consistency, alignment, and proximity highlight the overarching </span>
                <span>importance of contrast. We are instinctively designed to identify contrast. When contrast exists without cause, </span>
                <span>we can be left confused, searching for the meaning. Contrast can communicate organization through either </span>
                <span>simple groupings or more detailed hierarchies. We perceive contrast in color, brightness, </span>
                <span>size, polarity, orientation, and position. Proper use of contrast is essential to effective communication in interface design.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0052] While it is again expected that sufficient contrast will exist between a lit and </span>
                <span>unlit stacklight, we will belabor the example to highlight the related design concept. </span>
                <span>Within a stacklight, it is expected that an individual lamp will provide sufficient </span>
                <span>brightness to ensure that an operator can effectively distinguish between the lit and unlit states. </span>
                <span>Likewise, it is expected that the contrast between lamps (e.g., red to amber) is sufficient to ensure </span>
                <span>that the operator will correctly &ndash; without hesitation &ndash; identify the active lamps. </span>
                <span>It is important to note here </span>
                <span>that the operator's ability to interpret the correct lamp states is a function of both </span>
                <span>the lights themselves (e.g., brightness, color) and the surrounding environment. Specifically it </span>
                <span>is critical to consider the operator's perspective when viewing the lamps. It is possible that the </span>
                <span>structures behind a stacklight will impair the operator's ability to correctly perceive the active </span>
                <span>lamp. Proper positioning of all operator interfaces should take into consideration the impact of the </span>
                <span>surrounding environment and context of use. </span>
            </p>

            <h3 id="StacklightsContrast">4.7 Speaking the Operator's Language</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0053] While it is reasonable to use the conventions of position, color, and sequence to draw </span>
                <span>an operator's attention to a given machine, it is still necessary to communicate the </span>
                <span>required course of action in a manner that speaks more directly and effectively to the </span>
                <span>operator. It is not sufficient, for example, to blink the blue lamp in the stacklight and expect the operator to know </span>
                <span>what action is necessary. While the push-button controls offer guidance in some scenarios, the </span>
                <span>graphical interface must effectively communicate the </span>
                <span>meaning of the blinking blue lamp by presenting an instruction that leads to a prompt </span>
                <span>resolution.</span></p>
            <p>
                <span>[0054] Operators that have been drawn to a machine with an effective stacklight indication should </span>
                <span>be greeted with a message they can appropriately identify and act upon. Hierarchy within the </span>
                <span>graphical interface is essential for this task. The approaching operator should quickly identify </span>
                <span>the required action when they scan the graphical interface. Instructions that lack prominence </span>
                <span>will delay the recovery of the production line. Lack of contrast and emphasis (e.g., size, boldness, </span>
                <span>color) will reduce the saliency of the operator instruction. Be sure the instruction presented to </span>
                <span>the operator is easily identified. Testing of the implementation should be employed to ensure the instructions are identified </span>
                <span>in a consistent manner.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0055] Avoiding generic instructions (e.g., HELD) in favor of machine specific instructions (e.g., Empty </span>
                <span>the Under Bin and Press Start) will expedite operator response and line recovery. Where appropriate, </span>
                <span>utilize conventions like AECMA (Association Europeenee des Constructeurs de Material Aerospatial) </span>
                <span>Simplified English, which communicate to a broader audience through grammatical conventions. While </span>
                <span>the guidance specifically targets English-speaking operators in international contexts, the conventions demonstrate the more broadly applicable importance of establishing </span>
                <span>language patterns that are sufficient to reduce the required level of language </span>
                <span>proficiency (Mills & Caldwell, 1997). Similar guidance is offered in the forthcoming Safety of Machinery  &ndash; </span>
                <span>Instruction Handbook ISO 20607. As noted by the scope of that standard, if effective communication affects </span>
                <span>safety, it surely impacts usability as well. In general, interfaces should avoid abbreviations, jargon, acronyms, </span>
                <span>and engineering-centric language, which will likely be lost on line operators. Reserve engineering conventions </span>
                <span>for log files, which will not require interpretation from line operators.</span>

            <h3 id="StateModelScope">5.1 Scope</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0056] This section of the guidance will specify the steps necessary to present the standard ANSI/ISA </span>
                <span>TR88.00.02-2015 PackML state model in a consistent and effective manner. More specifically, this section focuses </span>
                <span>on the unique requirements for presenting the state model on a machine's HMI. In keeping with the themes </span>
                <span>expressed previously, the guidance and associated design requirements prioritize the goals of the production-line operator. </span>
                <span>The guidance illustrates the typical design challenges that designers must overcome and offers specific recommendations </span>
                <span>that focus on accommodating the needs of the production operator. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0057] From the engineer's perspective, the state model &ndash; demonstrated again in Figure 10 &ndash; represents </span>
                <span>the underlying control programming that ensures machines across a production line will operate in a correct and </span>
                <span>predictable fashion. Achieving this level of standardization across the packaging industry has elevated the </span>
                <span>state model diagram to iconic status; a symbol of the collaboration and harmonization achieved within the industry. </span>
                <span>Does this representation hold equivalent value for the operator? Likely not. The operator simply needs to understand </span>
                <span>the current state of the machine and any actions necessary on his or her part. Accordingly, while the traditional visual representation </span>
                <span>is encouraged where it can be accommodated, a faithful representation is not paramount. </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>[0058] Fortunately, despite some level of imprecision, the active machine state will be adequately represented by the </span>
                <span>stacklight and push-button standards established here. The associated HMI components (i.e., lamps and illuminated buttons) visually communicate </span>
                <span>the current machine state (e.g., Held, Suspended) and direct the operator when command execution is required (e.g., Reset button blinking). </span>
                <span>With the exception of the solid green lamp, activity is required when any other lamp sequence is active (e.g., Flashing Green, Solid Red). While these components </span>
                <span>satisfy many of the requirements that might otherwise be communicated through the state diagram, the lamps and the </span>
                <span>state diagram cannot directly communicate the machine-specific causes of certain production conditions (e.g., bin full, material low); </span>
                <span>communicating this information via text instructions on the HMI display is more appropriate. To that end, we argue that using precious HMI screen real estate </span>
                <span>to communicate specific detailed information (e.g., data, trends, operator instructions) is more critical than displaying the PackML state diagram. </span>
                <span>The associated requirements for a Standard PackML State Model HMI Representation are aligned with these priorities.</span>

            <p>
                <span>[0060] Displays presenting the PackML state diagram must maintain the alignment demonstrated in Figure 10. For example, horizontal </span>
                <span>alignment of the Unholding, Starting, Unsuspending, and Stopping states must be maintained. Likewise, vertical alignment of the </span>
                <span>Idle, Starting, Execute, Completing, and Complete states must be maintained. If a properly aligned diagram cannot be displayed </span>
                <span>(e.g., screen size too small) then the full diagram should not be displayed.</span>
            </p>

                    <span>If the alignment demonstrated in the right-hand example cannot be maintained, then the full diagram should not be displayed. </span>

            </figure>
            <p>
                <span>[0061] When displaying the state model, all states should be displayed regardless of their implementation in the active </span>
                <span>PackML mode. If &ndash; for example &ndash; the Completing and Complete states are not implemented in the current PackML mode, </span>
                <span>these states should still be displayed in the diagram. Their representation, however, should be muted to communicate that </span>
                <span>they are not active within the model. Figure 12 demonstrates a representation of the state model where the </span>
                <span>Completing and Complete states have no functional purpose (i.e., they are pass-through states) and are therefore presented with a reduced level of contrast.</span>

            <p>
                <span>[0062] If the full model cannot be displayed with proper alignment, the simplest acceptable alternative is to merely display the active PackML state. </span>
                <span>When compared to the example on the left, the redesigned alternative in Figure 13 presents the operator with just as much information; </span>
                <span>the machine is in the Execute state. That is not to say, however, that the minimalist representation is sufficient. The redesigned alternative </span>
                <span>in Figure 13 can now accommodate additional information, which will enhance the operator's situational awareness. </span>

                <span>[0063] While the specific metrics used to effectively report system state must be decided on a per-machine basis, the example in Figure 14 </span>
                <span>demonstrates a visualization that has been designed to report both the machine state, as well as other data points that will enhance </span>
                <span>the operator's situational awareness. These specific metrics are not required and only represent one possible way of effectively reporting </span>
                <span>machine conditions. </span>

            <h3 id="StateModelDataInk">5.3 Data-Ink Ratio</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0065] Tufte (1983) argued that the data communicated by a given display should always be optimized and that unnecessary noise should be eliminated. </span>
                <span>Originally considered in the context of </span>
                <span>print media, the optimal data-ink ratio is one where every drop of ink contributes value equal to its intensity. If the ink does not </span>
                <span>communicate any data then its place on the page cannot be justified; zero value, zero ink. Carrying the argument further, if the ink contributes </span>
                <span>only a small amount of data value it should be presented with a limited amount of visual impact (e.g., small, low contrast). Figure 15 presents </span>
                <span>a scatter plot redesigned to optimize the data-ink ratio. In this example, the outer border of the plot is completely removed as it holds no </span>
                <span>data value. The grid lines and axes are redrawn in a less dominant grey color, which replaces the more bold black color used in the original. </span>
                <span>The individual data points are redrawn without an inner fill, which is more conducive displaying overlapping points while also presenting a </span>
                <span>more light-weight esthetic. Each of these changes contributes to a higher data-ink ratio. Overall, the impact of non-data-ink is reduced, </span>
                <span>therefore, the ratio is improved. </span>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img id="data_ink_ratio" src="images/data-ink-example.png" />
                <figcaption>
                    <span>Figure 15: The chart on the right has been redesigned to produce an equivalent with a higher data-ink ratio. The left-hand chart's </span>
                    <span>border is removed and the black grid lines and axes are replaced with less dominant grey equivalents. The solid data points are </span>
                    <span>replaced by points with stroke but no fill. Some axis labels are removed, others are simply replaced by smaller grey equivalents. </span>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                <span>This simple concept facilitated the more heavy-handed redesign demonstrated in Figure 13. </span>
                <span>Often, it is far too easy to add digital ink to a display. The urgency to fill every empty space with content is natural for those </span>
                <span>confined within the borders of a QVGA display. However &ndash; from the operator's perspective &ndash; the majority of the PackML state model </span>
                <span>is digital noise. The inactive PackML states (i.e., those states supported by the machine, that are not currently active) provide no additonal </span>
                <span>information to the operator. Rendering those states, therefore, is not </span>
                <span>beneficial to the operator. Figure 13 offers the minimalist equivalent of the state diagram. It satisfies the most important question </span>
                <span>the complete diagram can: what is the current state?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0066] The redesigned alternative, however, is not necessarily sufficient as it leaves gaps in the operator's situational awareness. </span>
                <span>With the space reclaimed by eliminating the non-data-ink, the design can now accommodate additional data that could not be rendered </span>
                <span>in the previous visualization. Additional questions can now be answered. How long has the machine been in the Execute state? </span>
                <span>What is the current OEE? How many times has the machine been Suspended or Held since Starting? Presenting such data offers far more </span>
                <span>value than rendering 17 inactive machine states. As stated previously, the appropriate questions will depend on the target machine </span>
                <span>and the associated production environment. The Data-Ink Ratio concept simply guides the designer to ensure that the rendered content </span>
                <span>is focused, first and foremost, on communicating data. Every pixel should be optimized to ensure it communicates either data or nothing. Accomplishing </span>
                <span>this objective requires a proper application of contrast within the interface.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="StateModelContrast">5.4 Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0067] An HMI with properly applied contrast will help the operator focus their attention on the areas of a display that are most </span>
                <span>relevant to the task at hand. An interface that is densely populated with content can still highlight key pieces of data without </span>
                <span>the noise of supplementary data distracting the operator's attention. Contrast is achieved by varying the intensity of the elements </span>
                <span>displayed on the screen. For text elements, contrast can be achieved by varying the font size used to display the associated content. </span>
                <span>Additionally, text can be presented in different colors (e.g., black or grey) to communicate the level of emphasis appropriate for the </span>
                <span>content. By carefully selecting an appropriate text size and color for each screen element, the interface will communicate hierarchy without </span>
                <span>the need for heavy-handed visual guides. Considering again the minimalist PackML state diagram presented earlier, Figure 16 presents a simple yet consistent </span>
                <span>application of contrast aimed at guiding the viewer's attention toward data and away from "noise". In this example, one could argue that </span>
                <span>the labels decorating the actual data constitute noise. In order to effectively balance the interface, the design must use text size </span>
                <span>and color to direct the operator's attention across the display toward the key pieces of data, with minimal emphasis on content that </span>
                <span>does not contribute to situational awareness.</span>
            </p>

                    <span>Figure 16: Contrast can be used to focus the operator's attention on specific screen elements. The "Execute" PackML state is presented </span>
                    <span>in black with a 52 pt font size. This is the most visually dominant screen element in terms of both size and color. </span>
                    <span>The Time in State, OEE, and Held Events values (i.e., 14:23, 78%, and 6, respectively) are the next most salient, displayed in a dark </span>
                    <span>grey (i.e., not black), but with a 29 pt font size. </span>
                    <span>Finally, the labels (i.e., "Time in State", "OEE", and "Held Events") are shown in a lighter grey at a 16 pt font size. These combinations </span>
                    <span>of color and size establish hierarchy within the display, which guides the operator's eye more efficiently. </span>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3 id="StateModelConsistency">5.5 Consistency</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0068] Given the previous argument that all non-data-ink should be eliminated, it is reasonable to question the decision to display </span>
                <span>PackML states that are not supported in a particular mode for a given machine type. Since these states do not communicate any data, the display's data-ink </span>
                <span>ratio would clearly be improved if they were hidden. In this scenario, however, we argue that establishing consistency </span>
                <span>of the display should take precedence over the data-ink ratio. The goal of providing the operator a consistent interface while </span>
                <span>concurrently reducing the data-ink ratio is achieved by reducing the effective contrast of the PackML states that are not </span>
                <span>represented in the active machine mode. A muted representation for one or more states, as demonstrated in Figure 12, is sufficient to communicate </span>
                <span>the fact that the associated states are not part of the target machine's PackML State Model. </span>
            </p>            
            <p>
                <span>[0069] Consistency is therefore employed to avoid any distractions to the operator. Maintaining proper alignment within the state model </span>
                <span>avoids unecessary confusion. By following the standard, the operator will not interpret misaligned states as something meaningful. The </span>
                <span>operator will never question why there are gaps in the state model. Muting inactive states is a necessary compromise to both maintain </span>
                <span>consistency in content and alignment, while concurrently communicating the nature of those states within the model.</span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="StateModelColorDesign">5.6 Color Design</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0070] The previous discussion of contrast hinted to the effectiveness of color in highlighting elements on the screen. The example </span>
                <span>in Figure 16 demonstrates that the pure black text provides the maximum level of contrast against a white background. Demonstrated </span>
                <span>again here in Figure 17, we see that increasing the level of brightness in a color transitions that color toward pure white, which </span>
                <span>provides no contrast against a white background. The grey levels achieved in between pure black and pure white allow the designer to </span>
                <span>provide a level of contrast appropriate to a specific task (e.g., data: black, labels: grey, grid lines: light grey). In the digital RGB (i.e., Red-Green-Blue) </span>
                <span>color model (i.e., that used by many design tools), pure black is represented as RGB: 0, 0, 0, whereas pure white is represented as RGB: 255, 255, 255. </span>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img id="packml_state_model_brightness" src="images/Brightness.png" />

                    <span>Figure 17: Pure black (i.e., RGB: 0, 0, 0) provides the maximum level of contrast against a pure white (i.e., RGB: 255, 255, 255) background. Increasing brightness in 20% increments transitions </span>
                    <span>black to grey to white. </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0071] When a specific hue is selected, like the cyan background of our sample PackML diagram, the level of impact contributed by the color is correlated to the saturation level. </span>
                <span>Figure 18 demonstrates the impact of reducing the saturation of a cyan hue (i.e., RGB: 0, 217, 255). </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0072] When used together, the hue, saturation, and brightness (HSB) properties provide a convenient alternative to the more common RGB color model as </span>
                <span>the HSB model provides a more intuitive approach to color design. Given a specific color, adjustments to the saturation and brightness properties </span>
                <span>will produce a second color that appropriately complements the original, while being more subdued or more bold. Figure 19 demonstrates some of the </span>

                <span>[0074] Most dedicated design tools offer access to the RGB and HSB models. This facilitates design of a color palette using the HSB model, </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0074] In general, highly saturated colors should be reserved for the select interface components requiring the most attention. </span>
                <span>In this example (i.e., the background colors of the PackML state diagram) it is difficult to argue that such a highly </span>
                <span>saturated color is warranted. While there is sufficient contrast between the active state (i.e., Execute) and the background, </span>
                <span>a more neutral background is likely warranted. In this situation a more desaturated color would make a more suitable backdrop </span>
                <span>for the state diagram. Additionally, considering data ink ratio once again, it is also reasonable to remove the solid black border </span>
                <span>that outlines the inner-state background area. These changes are demonstrated in Figure 22. </span>

                <span>visual impact they introduce. The typeface has been replaced with a more condensed design where less horizontal space is required to display each label. </span>
                <span>Finally, the size of the inactive state labels has been reduced &ndash; from 10pt to 8pt &ndash; leaving the active state more visually dominant within the display. </span>
                <span>These changes demonstrate some of the possible methods for optimizing any operator interface. While these changes may not be possible in all environments, </span>
                <span>it is worth understanding the available flexibility and potential impact for each design.</span>

                <span>[0077] When selecting colors, it is often important to address accessibility concerns; specifically, accessibility for color blindness. Figure 25 demonstrates </span>
                <span>the Figure 24 concepts as they would be seen by an operator with protanopia-type color blindness. Figure 26 demonstrates the equivalant for </span>

                <span>[0078] In these diagrams, color has been applied merely as a mechanism to align with the stack light standard. Misinterpretation of colors </span>
                <span>in this context is of little concern as only one state will be highlighted at a time. More care must be taken when misinterpretation of color </span>
                <span>can cause a misunderstanding on the part of the operator. A carefully designed color palette will help ensure that color-blind operators </span>
                <span>are accommodated. The examples in Figures 25 and 26 were generated using a special color-blindness filter available in Adobe Illustrator. </span>
                <span>Such tools allow the designer to see how their interfaces will be perceived by color-blind operators. Employing dual-coding </span>
                <span>(e.g., color plus text) is recommended in more complicated contexts.</span>

                <span>[0079] When presenting text on screen, the designer can employ a few simple techniques to help maximize readability </span> 
                <span>and establish the hierarchy that will guide the viewer effectively and efficiently through the screen's content. The example in Figure 16 demonstrates </span>
                <span>how varying the relative size of text elements can help construct this hierarchy. As expected, larger text draws more attention. The primary focal </span>
                <span>point in the example &ndash; the text presenting the PackML Execute state &ndash; is highlighted using a relatively dominant 52-point text size. </span>
                <span>While this same text size is not utilized for other </span>
                <span>purposes in this specific screen, it should be reused consistently elsewhere whenever a dominant focal point is required.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0080] The importance of this primary data display is further highlighted by a distinct pair of smaller text elements </span>
                <span>&ndash; each dedicated to a specific purpose &ndash; that bring order and communicate purpose for the remaining content. </span>
                <span>This unique combination of text sizes (i.e., 16 pt and 29 pt in grey and dark grey respectively) introduces a pattern that the </span>
                <span>viewer can anticipate and easily interpret. By consistently using these same sizes for the same purpose in the other </span>
                <span>areas of the HMI, the viewer will quickly identify data values and labels in a more instinctive manner. This improves both </span>
                <span>the learnability and memorability qualities of the interface.</span>
            </p>  
            <p>
                <span>[0081] Instead of using an arbitrary collection of text sizes, the example employs typographic scaling, which brings harmony to the display </span>
                <span>using a fixed multiplier that builds each successive text size from the last. </span>
                <span>The scale ensures that there is sufficient visual contrast between the display's effective </span>
                <span>levels (e.g., machine state, data values, data labels) such that the underlying hierarchy is more easily interpretted. </span>
                <span>Figure 27 presents some alternative typographic scales to help illustrate the concept. </span>
            </p>

                    <span>are more difficult to accommodate on smaller screens or more densely populated displays. Utilizing color is an effective </span>
                    <span>alternative to produce hierarchy at smaller scales. </span>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                <span>[0082] An effective typographic scale is established by first identifying </span>
                <span>the smallest effective text size. In this sample, a modest 16 pt text size has been selected. In keeping with the data-ink ratio concept,  </span>
                <span>this minimum text size will be used to present the least data-rich content (i.e., data labels). In practice, the appropriate minimum text </span>
                <span>size will be impacted by the size of the screen, the viewing distance and angle, the quality of the display, and a number of other </span>
                <span>context-specific variables that impact readability. Once the appropriate minimum size is determined, a fixed multiplier is selected </span>
                <span>to provide a linear increase in the text size of subsequent levels. A relatively large multiplier </span>
                <span>of 1.8x has been chosen in this example. With only 4 pieces of information, the interface can accommodate a larger scale than would </span>
                <span>otherwise be available on a display with more densely populated content. </span>                
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0083] The smallest scale in the example (i.e., 1.3x) provides less natural hierarchy via size. The hierarchy is enhanced through color, where </span>
                <span>the smallest text is presented in grey to produce additional contrast. At a scale of 1.8x, the hierarchy is more pronounced. The grey coloring on the data label </span>
                <span>is still utilized as there is no reason to increase the emphasis on that content. Progressing to the 2.5x scale shows more dynamic contrast, which </span>
                <span>is certainly more pronounced, but does not necessarily produce a more functional or aesthetically rich display. </span>
                <span>Altering the typeface itself, however, does offer an opportunity to improve both the aesthetic and functional characteristics of the interface. </span>

                <span>[0084] Figure 28 illustrates some of the flexibility offered by various typefaces. While Arial Regular and Halis Rounded Book </span>
                <span>offer similar personalities, variants like Arial Narrow help illustrate the functional benefits that some alternative fonts can afford. With a more compact </span>
                <span>body, Arial Narrow requires less horizontal space to display equivalent content without sacrificing height and, therefore, legibility. </span>
                <span>The demonstrated Halis fonts help illustrate the dynamic contrast afforded by light weight and small cap fonts. Light weight fonts are simply </span>
                <span>the opposite of more commonly utilized bold fonts. An alternative to smaller font sizes or lower contrast colors, a light weight font positioned </span>
                <span>adjacent to a regular font will likely draw less attention, while adding a clean and efficient aesthetic to the display. The small caps variants </span>
                <span>offer another method for drawing extra attention to an element. While it is more difficult to read content that is capitalized, it will draw extra </span>
                <span>attention from the viewer. Accordingly, caps and small caps should be avoided for longer text segments, but are appropriate for alarms and warnings. </span>

                <span>for the remainder of the word. Contrasted with the fully capitalized "EXECUTE" rendered in the normal font, we see that the more horizontal space is </span>
                <span>used and that there is more space between the individual letters. The small caps font is specifically designed to provide a more aesthetically pleasing </span>
                <span>rendering of the fully capitalized equipment. With less space between the letters, the small-caps version produces a visual that appears to be more fluid. </span>

                <span>lengths slow down reading speed. Additionally, it is more difficult to read text where the distance between lines is too small. Figure 30 </span>
                <span>demonstrates the impact line height has on legibility. Utilizing the preferred 120% guideline produces a more readable body of text.</span>

            <p>
                <span>[0087] For most production operators, time spent manipulating an HMI is time wasted. Engineers that </span>
                <span>design machine interfaces have an important responsibility to ensure that their operators perform </span>
                <spam>effectively. If an operator is not effective when utilizing a designer's interface, it is the </span>
                <span>designer who has failed, not the operator. In an effort to increase the likelihood of success for </span> 
                <span>our fellow designers, this section offers a standard graphical interface template tailored </span>
                <span>specifically for use in production environments. Isolated machine-level testing has demonstrated </span>
                <span>that the following guidelines offer measurable usability benefits, with further improvements expected </span>
                <span>when the practices are applied across full production lines. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0088] Understandably, given the vast array of facilities in a typical interface, </span>
                <span>establishing an appropriate scope for this section of the standard was the first critical milestone. </span>
                <span>When compared to the relatively finite number of possible variations available in </span>
                <span>the stacklight standard &ndash; where machine state is succinctly represented with nothing more than color, </span> 
                <span>position, and frequency &ndash; the main graphical interface on a production machine offers a wider landscape for </span>
                <span>competing design alternatives. Unfortunately, this flexibility often leads to haphazard designs where little to no </span>
                <span>consistency exists between machines. In many ways, the less complicated, yet more rigid, stacklight standard illustrates </span>
                <span>the ideal scope for use here in the graphical interface section. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0089] Considering the situational awareness model once again, we are reminded that an effective interface </span>
                <span>a) communicates the state of the world, b) affords insight into future conditions, and c) aids the </span>
                <span>operator's decision making process. The PackML stacklight offers situational awareness with incredible efficiency. </span>
                <span>A single flashing blue lamp, for example, is all that is needed to inform a remote line operator that 
                <span>an internal machine issue must be addressed. Ironically, it is the stacklight's inherent constraints </span>
                <span>that facilitate this situational awareness in such a usable manner. </span>
                <span>Despite the obvious limitations, a PackML stacklight is effectively a 4-pixel display, where: </span>
                <ul class="points">
                    <li>Each pixel has a fixed color; the blue pixel can only every be blue, and no other pixel may ever use that same color.</li>
                    <li>The pixels are aligned vertically so that their orientation is the same regardless of the operator's viewing angle.</li>
                    <li>Each pixel has a precise meaning that, once defined, does not change.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>These limitations and the resulting consistency are paramount to the stacklight's effectiveness. </span>                
            </p>
            <p>    
                <span>[0090] Carrying the analogy to the opposite extreme, the HMI terminal is nothing more than </span>
                <span>a 2-dimensional stacklight; it is reasonable to argue that the same benefits should be easily achieved. </span>
                <span>Unfortunately, the potential for chaos is far greater in the graphical domain. </span>
                <span>Whereas the stacklight's physical design provides natural hierarchy and content alignment, </span>
                <span>the graphical interface demands no such structure. Pixels are easily combined to form shapes </span>
                <span>and words that are arbitrarily sized and positioned on the display. These pixels quickly become </span>
                <span>rare commodities; there is always more content, never enough space. </span>
                <span>Content is then squeezed in here, crammed in there. Accordingly, a survey of machine </span>
                <span>interfaces in a typical production line will likely show little or no consistency in </span>
                <span>either content or alignment. Worse still, in a graphical inteface, the </span>
                <span>content and alignment may very well change dynamically as the operator interacts with the screen. </span>
                <span>The HMI working group began their effort with these challenges in mind.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0091] From the earliest stages of the standardization effort, agreement existed that the graphical-interface </span>
                <span>portion of the PackML HMI standard would need to be narrowly focused. It was argued that </span>
                <span>the scope should be limited to the small intersection of operator-interface components that are </span>
                <span>most commonly encountered on production equipment; expanding standardization beyond this </span>
                <span>boundary would artificially limit designers and inhibit innovation. Moreover, since no single design </span>
                <span>will ever offer the perfect interface for all operators, the HMI working group decided to avoid a ground-up design effort </span>
                <span>and chose, instead, to consider the merits of a selected set of existing design alternatives; each </span>
                <span>either currently in use or proposed for use in a production line.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0092] In an effort to quantify the effectiveness of these sample interfaces, </span>
                <span>the group conducted a formal usability study, which aimed to produce an unbiased </span>
                <span>evaluation of the respective systems. The study presented participants with a </span>
                <span>collection of interfaces, each of which organized screen content in a unique </span>
                <span>and intriguing manner. Participants were challenged to demonstrate basic situational </span>
                <span>awareness by reporting system information available within each interface. </span>
                <span>Following these exercises, participants offered qualitative feedback on the respective designs, noting </span>
                <span>general preferences and providing comments on perceived usability. The study results and subsequent </span>
                <span>review by the committee left the originally expressed opinions on scope largely unchanged. </span>
                <span>While the standard HMI template would have a relatively limited scope, a supplementary collection </span>
                <span>of design guidelines would be provided to help designers produce more effective interfaces </span>
                <span>without inhibiting innovation.</span>

                <span>[0093] Returning to the high-level HMI standardization goals &ndash; where </span>
                <span>the efficiency and effectiveness of line operators is the overarching priority &ndash; </span>
                <span>the effective transition from one interface to the next </span>
                <span>represents the primary benefit of the HMI template. This objective suggests </span>
                <span>that learnability, memorability, and efficiency are the key usability characteristics </span>
                <span>driving the template's design. Accordingly, it is reasonable to argue that the ideal </span>
                <span>template: a) follows expected conventions, b) maximizes consistency between machines, </span>
                <span>and c) ensures the operator feels they are in control. Given these criteria, the  </span>
                <span>standard PackML HMI template: </span>                
            </p>
            <ul class="points">
                <li>establishes a set of standard navigation elements</li>
                <li>specifies standard alignment and orientation patterns for these elements</li>
                <li>defines the auxiliary content operators rely on to make decisions in a production</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <span>[0094] The standard navigation elements represent the most frequently encountered </span>
                <span>menus and content groups found in production equipment. Following the best practices illustrated by the analysis of the stacklight </span>
                <span>design, each element is assigned a fixed position in the HMI's menu along with a </span>
                <span>standard name and icon representing the associated context. The template's alignment and </span>
                <span>orientation patterns are derived from the key findings of the usability study, which offered evidence  </span>
                <span>supporting established interface conventions from existing production HMIs. </span>
                <span>Concurrently, the study demonstrated that conventions employed in commercial products </span>
                <span>(e.g., mobile phones and tablets) do not map well to the production domain and should be avoided. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>[0095] With this scope established, the following sections will outline the specific components of the standard HMI template </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0096] The PackML HMI navigation standard includes: 1) a collection of standard navigation contexts including appropriate icons and labels, </span>
                <span>2) a pair of standard layout options for positioning of screen elements, and 3) a collection of common, yet optional, supplementary content. </span>
                <span>These standard HMI components offer the consistency operators need to move efficiently from machine to machine. </span>
            </p>
            <h3 id="NavigationStandardContexts">6.2.1 Navigation Contexts</h3>
            <p>
                <span>[0097] The standard PackML navigation template includes seven primary navigation contexts: </span>
                <span>a) Home, b) Products, c) Statistics, d) Alarms, e) Manual, f) Settings, and g) Diagnostics. </span>
                <span>These contexts represent the main conceptual groupings of content within production machines. </span>
                <span>The associated groupings have been derived from standard practice, accommodating the most commonly encountered production-industry content. </span>
                <span>Each context is presented on the display with a standard icon representing the associated context. </span>
                <span>A detailed description and example content for each of these contexts is provided in Table 3. </span>
                <span>Navigation is initiated by selecting one of these elements on the display. </span>
                <span>Subsequent navigation is then completed by choosing an element from the provided sub-menu. </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0105] The standard PackML HMI navigation template follows one of two basic patterns. The first pattern, demonstrated in Figure 31, presents the array </span>
                <span>of primary navigation elements spread horizontally along the lower edge of the HMI. </span>
            </p>
            <figure>

                    <span>These primary elements consist of a standard icon-label pair for representing the associated navigation context. </span>
                    <span>A text-only submenu, listing the different sections within each context, is presented along the left edge of the interface. </span>
                    <span>Note that the actively-selected primary and secondary elements are presented with a higher level of contrast, which </span>
                    <span>clearly highlights their active-selection state. </span>

            <p>
                <span>[0106] The main alternative pattern, as demonstrated in Figure 32, presents the array of primary navigation elements spread vertically </span>
                <span>along the left edge of the HMI. As with the previous pattern, navigation is initiated by selecting  </span>
                <span>one of the primary navigation elements positioned on the left edge of the screen. Subsequent navigation is initiated </span>
                <span>by selecting one of the secondary-level navigation links presented along the top of the screen. </span>
